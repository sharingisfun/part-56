Host Pat Dixon - along with a revolving guest list of NYC-based attorneys, reporters, cops and comedians - provides a decidedly irreverent, dark and unflinching tour of true crime in the city. Ripped from the blood-splattered headlines of NYC's tabloid press and broadcast from the ACN Studio in New York City; this is a one of a kind show that documents the farcical evolving chaos of the new Rome.\r\n\r\nGuest: Anthony Cumia\r\n\r\nEpisode 7: Pat is joined by the one and only Anthony Cumia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff3fdb0ab4d72dd46a6a43bc0f36c9b5172009bd","amp;dn":"NYC+Crime+Report+07+2015-12-08+Anthony+Cumia+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff3fdb0ab4d72dd46a6a43bc0f36c9b5172009bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,63,219,10,180,215,45,212,106,106,67,188,15,54,201,181,23,32,9,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
