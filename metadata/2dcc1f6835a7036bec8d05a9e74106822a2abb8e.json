Schneck, Joseph D. Bronzino (CRC, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0849314925\r\n\r\nBiomechanics: Principles and Applications offers a definitive, comprehensive review of this rapidly growing field, including recent advancements made by biomedical engineers to the understanding of fundamental aspects of physiologic function in health, disease, and environmental extremes. The chapters, each by a recognized leader in the field, address the subjects of biosolid mechanics and biofluid mechanics as they pertain to various subsystems of the human body. They also review applications such as sports biomechanics, repair and rehabilitation of body parts, and technology to support or replace ailing physiologic organs with prosthetic parts. A unique feature is the convenient handbook style and tabular format that puts quantitative data at your fingertips. Illustrations further add to the value of this book. The text is concise, topical, and not overly technical. No other book covers the entire field of biomechanics so succinctly in one volume","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dcc1f6835a7036bec8d05a9e74106822a2abb8e","amp;dn":"Biomechanics+Principles+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dcc1f6835a7036bec8d05a9e74106822a2abb8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,204,31,104,53,167,3,107,236,141,5,169,231,65,6,130,42,42,187,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
