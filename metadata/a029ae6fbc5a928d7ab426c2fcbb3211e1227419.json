Very unusual cops . . .\r\n\r\nHomicide detective Frank Bennett has an intriguing new partner. Dark, beautiful, coldly efficient, Eden Archer is one of the most enigmatic colleagues Frank has ever worked withâ€”that includes her brother Eric, whoâ€™s also on the Sydney Metro police force. All of them are tested to the core when a local man discovers a graveyard of large steel toolboxes lying at the bottom of the harbor. Each box contains a grisly trove of human body parts.\r\n\r\nFor Frank, the madmanâ€™s clues are a tantalizing puzzle. For Eden and Eric, the case holds chilling links to a scarred childhoodâ€”and a murderous mentor named Hades. But the true evil goes beyond the bloody handiwork of a serial killerâ€¦\r\n\r\n02.

Frankâ€™s job is to keep an eye on his partner while she's there - but is it for Eden's protection, or to protect others from her?
