Written by Matt Burns and James Waugh and drawn by Edouard Guiton and Emanuele Tenderini, Sacrifice tells the story of the different Protoss factions and their struggle to unite before their attempt to reclaim their shattered homeworld. Major events from the StarCraft: Brood War timeline are also depicted as we see how important Tassadarâ€™s friendship was in shaping the decision Artanis ultimately makes.\r\n\r\nThe events in this comic take place before scenes depicted in Reclamation so make sure to check it out if you want the full experience before Legacy of the Void launches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4214a004c1dcc7ad888340c832022894101ae427","amp;dn":"Starcraft+II+mini-comic+-+Artanis-Sacrifice+-+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4214a004c1dcc7ad888340c832022894101ae427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,20,160,4,193,220,199,173,136,131,64,200,50,2,40,148,16,26,228,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
