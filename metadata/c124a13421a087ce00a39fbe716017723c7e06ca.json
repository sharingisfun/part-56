When implanted, the tapeworm protects us from illness, boosts our immune system - even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost every human being has a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.\r\n\r\nBut these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives...and will do anything to get them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c124a13421a087ce00a39fbe716017723c7e06ca","amp;dn":"Mira+Grant+-+Parasite+%28Parasitology+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c124a13421a087ce00a39fbe716017723c7e06ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,36,161,52,33,160,135,206,0,163,159,190,113,96,23,114,60,126,6,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
