This edit seeks to streamline the story to more closely match the events of the books. Numerous subplots and extraneous characters were removed, extended action sequences have been shortened, and the flashback introduction has been recontextualized to a more appropriate place in the film's sequence.\r\n\r\nTotal running time: 3:51 with a 10-minute intermission after the climax from 'An Unexpected Journey' (around the 1:30 mark).\r\n\r\nFilesize: 3.8 GB\r\n\r\n&quot;Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold&quot; full version performed by Clamavi de Profundis.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47d12178e38ef54906a432dd04dfedbc7ef969d","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit%2C+or+There+and+Back+Again","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47d12178e38ef54906a432dd04dfedbc7ef969d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,125,18,23,142,56,239,84,144,106,67,45,208,77,254,219,199,239,150,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
