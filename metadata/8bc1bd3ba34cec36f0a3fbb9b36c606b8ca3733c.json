This book provides the historical background of pesticides and emerging trends in pesticide regulation. The text discusses various techniques for analysis, including supercritical fluid extraction, disposable electrochemical biosensors, matrix solid-phase dispersion, volatmetric methods, and liquid chromatography. The authors also address the scope and limitation of NEEM products in plant protection as well as the analysis of medicinal plants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc1bd3ba34cec36f0a3fbb9b36c606b8ca3733c","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Pesticides+-+Methods+of+Pesticide+Residues+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc1bd3ba34cec36f0a3fbb9b36c606b8ca3733c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,193,189,59,163,76,236,54,240,163,251,185,179,108,96,107,140,163,115,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
