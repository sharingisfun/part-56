The default setting is *.zip;*.jar;*.xlsx;*.docx;*.pptx\r\n- Prompt to 'Fix Line Endings': By default the internal context viewer prompts to fix the line endings in a file if the file contains mixed line boundaries, e.g., some lines are 'Unix' and others are 'PC' format.\r\n\r\nFSConfig runs on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, 32 &amp; 64-bit editions.\r\n\r\nTorrent includes Funduc Replace Studio Pro 7.5 RETAIL [FOSI] Installers (x86/x64)\r\n+ Portable versions (x86/x64), including the standalone configuration utility FSConfig\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.funduc.com/replace_studio_pro.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a38f14e098e2bdd8c75c8939bcced435fb095094","amp;dn":"Funduc+Replace+Studio+Professional+7.5+Retail+FOSI+%2B+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a38f14e098e2bdd8c75c8939bcced435fb095094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,143,20,224,152,226,189,216,199,92,137,57,188,206,212,53,251,9,80,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
