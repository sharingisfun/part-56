Leyzerovich (Fairmont, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0881735485\r\n\r\nThis book presents the newest approaches to design and operation of new steam turbines, along with modern techniques for refurbishment of aging units, for fossil fuel power plants. Recent engineering breakthroughs have led to potential increases in power plant efficiency, deriving both from qualitative improvements in turbine steam path design, and from transitions to a greater use of elevated steam conditions. New approaches also have emerged relative to transient operating conditions, as well as improved information support for operational personnel. Intended to serve as an authoritative guide for power plant engineers, operators, owners and designers on all of these crucial developments, this book fully describes and evaluates the most important new design and operational improvement opportunities for the full spectrum of today's steam turbines - from the newest and most advanced to the more common existing systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb1c1b8bc6c9d116a8f72de411e0c0070d8937c","amp;dn":"Steam+Turbines+for+Modern+Fossil-Fuel+Power+Plants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb1c1b8bc6c9d116a8f72de411e0c0070d8937c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,177,193,184,188,108,157,17,106,143,114,222,65,30,12,0,112,216,147,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
