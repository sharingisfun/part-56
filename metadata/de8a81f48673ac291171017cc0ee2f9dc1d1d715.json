The invited authors present the latest results in this exciting multidisciplinary field of their own research group. \r\n\r\nMany of the contributors working in both fields over many decades were in close collaboration with the late Prof. H. Ti Tien, the founding editor of this book series. There are also chapters written by some of the younger generation of scientists included in this series. This volume keeps in mind the broader goal with both systems, planar lipid bilayers and spherical liposomes, which is the further development of this interdisciplinary field worldwide. \r\n\r\n* Incorporates contributions from newcomers and established and experienced researchers \r\n* Explores the planar lipid bilayer systems and spherical liposomes from both theoretical and experimental perspectives\r\n* Serves as an indispensable source of information for new scientists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de8a81f48673ac291171017cc0ee2f9dc1d1d715","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Planar+Lipid+Bilayers+and+Liposomes+Vol.+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de8a81f48673ac291171017cc0ee2f9dc1d1d715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,138,129,244,134,115,172,41,17,113,1,124,192,238,47,157,193,209,215,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
