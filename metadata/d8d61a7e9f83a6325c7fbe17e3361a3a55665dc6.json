Ex-G.I. buddies Steve Martin and Johnny Gambi have spent all their mustering out pay to gamble on a wild scheme. Steve is convinced that there is oil out in the bay, and he knows how to get at it. With a mix of hucksterism and the passion of a true visionary, Steve convinces the lease holder, oil tycoon Kermit McDonald, to bankroll the building of an offshore oil rig.\r\n\r\nAlthough filmed in the standard 1.37-1 aspect ratio, Thunder Bay was chosen by Universal-International as its first wide screen feature, accomplishing this by cropping the top and bottom and projecting it at 1.85-1 at Loew's State Theatre in New York City, as well as other sites. Its initial presentation also marked U-I's first use of directional stereophonic sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 512x384, 25.000 fps, 1295 Kbps, 01h38m32s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio tracks English and Spanish\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Croatian, English, French, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/48570d4sh/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ct1ilguut/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/nrcs3njg5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/euxelz3g5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/x97xpyfqt/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d61a7e9f83a6325c7fbe17e3361a3a55665dc6","amp;dn":"Thunder+Bay+%281953+-+USA%29+%5BJames+Stewart%5D+multi+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d61a7e9f83a6325c7fbe17e3361a3a55665dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,214,26,126,159,131,166,50,92,127,190,23,227,54,26,58,85,102,93,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
