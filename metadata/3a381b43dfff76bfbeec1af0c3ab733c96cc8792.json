The protagonist goes on a journey that takes him in quite a different direction than swordsmen in Hong Kong movies usually went. After a swordfight under the credits in which the protagonist, Ding Menghao, the &quot;Fastest Sword&quot; of the title, dispatches three challengers, a hairy, 80-year-old monk who witnessed the fight proceeds to bait Ding.\r\n If the monk, armed only with a long metal smoking pipe, wins a bout with him, then Ding must agree to serve as his apprentice for two years. The monk wins with a deft, unexpected move, and Ding is soon stuck in an old temple, at first meditating, then copying scriptures, and finally ordered to sculpt something out of a boulder within six months.\r\n He crafts a creditable Buddha and the monk comes back and tells him to make something smaller out of it during the next six months. He makes a statue of a monk with an upraised palm and when the monk comes back, he orders something still smaller within the next six months.\r\n Finally, the monk is satisfied with the result and tells Ding he has great talent as a mason and sends him on his way.\r\n\r\nAfter some more travels--and more swordfights--Ding decides to forego fighting and winds up in a remote village under an assumed name working as a stone mason. Unfortunately, as usually happens in this kind of tale, his past catches up with him and he eventually faces a persistent challenger, Qiu Xiying, the &quot;fastest sword in the north,&quot; who's chomping at the bit to have a duel with Ding, &quot;the fastest sword in the south.&quot;\r\n But, despite an intervening attack by bandits, Ding does manage to stick to his new-found principles for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS:\r\n  \nhttp://someimage.com/wV1bwfr\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjackers, from The Chop Shop.\r\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
