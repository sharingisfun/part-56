The astoundingly adept trumpeter was always greatly appreciated by Thelonious, who quickly accepted the invitation to accompany Terry on this occasion. It was an album full of firsts and rarities: Monk's only Riverside appearance as a sideman; the first of Terry's many recordings on flugelhorn; the first of a great many Riverside dates for the great bassist Sam Jones; and the only occasion on which Monk and drummer Philly Joe Jones recorded together.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - In Orbit\r\n02 - One Foot In The Gutter\r\n03 - Trust In Me\r\n04 - Let's Cool One\r\n05 - Pea-Eye\r\n06 - Argentia\r\n07 - Moonlight Fiesta\r\n08 - Buck's Business\r\n09 - Very Near Blue\r\n10 - Flugelin' The Blues\r\n\r\n*1987 Riverside / Fantasy / ZYX Music | OJCCD-302-2 {Riverside-OJC}\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nClark Terry â€“ flugelhorn\r\nThelonious Monk â€“ piano\r\nSam Jones â€“ bass\r\nPhilly Joe Jones â€“ drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af8a1a8959aa460878866d0db00c36fea140371","amp;dn":"Clark+Terry+with+Thelonious+Monk+-+In+Orbit+%281958%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af8a1a8959aa460878866d0db00c36fea140371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,248,161,168,149,154,164,96,135,136,102,208,219,0,195,111,234,20,3,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
