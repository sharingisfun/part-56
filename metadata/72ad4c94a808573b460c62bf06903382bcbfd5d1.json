Back in 1978 he had gained notoriety as â€œthe Mad Chopperâ€ for raping and cutting off the arms of 15-year-old Mary Vincent on a patch of desolate, sun-scorched land 5 miles off the highway near Modesto, California.\r\n \r\nWhen Singleton was let out of prison on supervised parole after serving only 8 years for his crimes, no community in California would accept him. He eventually moved back to his home in Florida, where he killed Hayes nearly 20 years after his original crime. But his first victim, Vincent, had survived, walking nearly a mile to get help after the assault, and testified against him at his trial for murdering Hayes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72ad4c94a808573b460c62bf06903382bcbfd5d1","amp;dn":"The+Mad+Chopper+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72ad4c94a808573b460c62bf06903382bcbfd5d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,173,76,148,168,8,87,59,70,12,98,191,6,144,51,130,188,191,213,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
