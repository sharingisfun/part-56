This is a 4GB live DVD with a nice collection of games, as well as the XBMC (now called Kodi) media centre software, PlayOnLinux and the Steam client: &quot;It is the ultimate entertainment system. It has a list of games that just scrolls by on the screen even on a 4K monitor. It does not stop there - XBMC has been pre-injected and set up into the system with over a million channels and streams to cut the cable TV bill on 69 networks, and the ability to add more. Compiz is back and rocking right off the live disk. Productivity? The entire LibreOffice suite is also included. Wine and PlayOnLinux are pre-installed to allow you to play your Windows games, not to mention Steam. This one fits on a DVD. I want to break down this for the gamers - I can play more games in this OS than on any Windows OS.&quot; See the release announcement for more information  http://ultimateedition.info/index.php/gamers/ultimate-entertainment/  .
