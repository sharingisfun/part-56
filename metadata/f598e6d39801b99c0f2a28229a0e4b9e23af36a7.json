Niemz (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9783540721918\r\n\r\nMedical practitioners, scientists and graduate students alike will find this exhaustive survey a vital learning tool. It provides a thorough description of the fundamentals and applications in the field of laser-tissue interactions. Basic concepts such as the optical and thermal properties of tissue, the various types of tissue ablation, and optical breakdown and its related effects are treated in detail. The author pays special attention to mathematical tools (Monte Carlo simulations, the Kubelka-Munk theory etc.) and approved techniques (photodynamic therapy, laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy etc.). A section on applications reviews clinically relevant methods in modern medicine using the latest references","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f598e6d39801b99c0f2a28229a0e4b9e23af36a7","amp;dn":"Laser-Tissue+Interactions+Fundamentals+and+Applications+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f598e6d39801b99c0f2a28229a0e4b9e23af36a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,152,230,211,152,1,185,156,15,42,40,34,154,14,75,158,35,175,54,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
