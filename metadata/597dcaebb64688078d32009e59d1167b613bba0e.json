What do we have here?\r\n              A melodic and hypnotic first person role playing album!\r\n              You play as Faxi Nadu, a hero who is unsure if he is\r\n              fighting dragons or exploring space so he does both just\r\n              to make sure. This whole album is kinda strange\r\n              (although one could make the case that Faxi Nadu\r\n              is always kinda strange) with a lot of inspiration drawn\r\n              from gaming into deep fantasy worlds. In space with\r\n              Mass Effect, fighting dragons in Skyrim, and going for the\r\n              glitz and glam in Yakuza. This album is a story of stories,\r\n              of places, of times, of meetings, of feelings, of emotion,\r\n              of the external and of the internal, and most of all this\r\n              album is the story of us, from the very first to The Last\r\n              of Us.
