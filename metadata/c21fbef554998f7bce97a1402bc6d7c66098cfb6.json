The band has nothing to do with this album, it was fully made by &quot;NHK&quot; who are responsible for the most ugly booklet/design ever made, as well as the content chosen (15 % of the video recording were put on a DVD). The sales were a complete failure. Musically speaking, it's perfect as usual","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c21fbef554998f7bce97a1402bc6d7c66098cfb6","amp;dn":"Asian+Kung-Fu+Generation+-+The+Recording","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c21fbef554998f7bce97a1402bc6d7c66098cfb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,31,190,245,84,153,143,123,206,151,161,64,43,198,215,198,96,152,207,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
