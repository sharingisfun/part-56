This volume is dedicated to the statistical thermodynamics of adhesion points in supported membranes, the study of stability of exocytotic fusion pore, membrane instability of a planar lipid bilayer in an electric field, possible mechanisms of raft formation in cell membranes, computer simulations of multicomponent lipid bilayers and liposomes using coarse-grained models, thermal fluctuations of lipid vesicles, and interactions of biologically important molecules with lipid molecules","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45f759ca2fca38c2770240086667ef89e672937","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Planar+Lipid+Bilayers+and+Liposomes+Vol.+14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45f759ca2fca38c2770240086667ef89e672937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,95,117,156,162,252,163,140,39,112,36,0,134,102,126,248,158,103,41,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
