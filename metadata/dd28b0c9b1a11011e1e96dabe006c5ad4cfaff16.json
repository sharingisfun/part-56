Andrews et al. (Blackwell, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0632059052\r\n\r\nThis introductory text explains the fundamentals of the chemistry of the natural environment and the effects of mankind's activities on the earth's chemical systems. It retains an emphasis on describing how natural geochemical processes operate over a variety of scales in time and space, and how the effects of human perturbation can be measured. The topics range from familiar global issues such as atmospheric pollution and its effect on global warming and ozone destruction, to microbiological processes that cause pollution of drinking water deltas. It contains sections and information boxes that explain the basic chemistry underpinning the subject covered. Each chapter contains a list of further reading on the subject area. It includes updated case studies. No prior chemistry knowledge is required. It is suitable for introductory level courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd28b0c9b1a11011e1e96dabe006c5ad4cfaff16","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Environmental+Chemistry+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd28b0c9b1a11011e1e96dabe006c5ad4cfaff16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,40,176,201,177,161,16,17,225,233,109,171,224,6,197,173,76,250,255,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
