And don't forget to run away once you have accomplished your task!\r\nOnce all 20 levels have been conquered, a high score mode (&quot;Endless Raid&quot;) will be unlocked where levels have to tackled randomly. How far can you go?\r\n\r\nRequired Android O/S : 4.1+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ada32dd52fcdb4f0edc7fbe8c0c188db094224b","amp;dn":"Robin+Hood%3A+Give+and+Take+v1.11+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ada32dd52fcdb4f0edc7fbe8c0c188db094224b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,218,50,221,82,252,219,79,14,220,127,190,140,12,24,141,176,148,34,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
