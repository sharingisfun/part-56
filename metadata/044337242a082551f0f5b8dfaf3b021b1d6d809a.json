They have been archived using 7zip &amp; can be extracted using many different archive extractors, the complete set unpacked is 352Gb and are shrunk down to 5Gb total. Each wordlist is around 250Mb in archive form and around 14-20Gb in extracted. The following are the other rules applied (please contact me if you notice any that shouldn't apply with proof please)\r\n\r\nOnly combinations which meet these criteria will be printed:\r\nâ€¢ each character cannot appear more than 3 times\r\nâ€¢ no 3 characters in a row can be identical\r\nâ€¢ no 3 characters in a row can be sequential (abc)\r\nâ€¢ no 3 characters in a row can be reverse sequential (cba)\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not equal to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not +1 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not +2 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not +3 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not +4 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not +5 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not -1 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not -3 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 2 is not -4 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not equal to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not +2 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not equal to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not +2 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not +3 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not +4 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not +5 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not -1 to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not -2 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not -4 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 3 is not -5 to character 2\r\nâ€¢ character 5 is not equal to character 1\r\nâ€¢ character 5 is not equal to character 4\r\nâ€¢ character 8 is not equal to character 6\r\nâ€¢ characters 1 and 3 and 4 are not identical\r\nâ€¢ characters 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 are not identical\r\nâ€¢ characters 2, 3 and 8 cannot be identical\r\nâ€¢ characters 3 and 5, and 4 and 6 are not identical\r\n\r\nThese wordlists will reduce the cracking time of Virgin media (and any other ISP that uses a-z but doesn't use i or o) by a huge amount &amp; also save you money in the process! I will also be adding new links using multi upload sites eventually so that the files last longer therefore shouldn't need to be maintained.\r\n\r\nI made and uploaded these lists because I found that using the generator and piping into oclhashcat would only giver me around 85000H/s whereas my R9 290X is capable of 195000 so although the lists were shrunk it would still take a lot of time. Also these lists can be kept and saved as they are archived to a total of 5Gb so saves time having to generate them over &amp; over again!\r\nAgain, this wouldn't be possible without Eleadon so a huge thanks to him for bringing the generators to the community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:044337242a082551f0f5b8dfaf3b021b1d6d809a","amp;dn":"Virgin+media+%28UK%29+a-z+wordlists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"044337242a082551f0f5b8dfaf3b021b1d6d809a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,67,55,36,42,8,37,81,240,245,184,223,175,59,2,27,29,109,128,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
