Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests: Rich Vos, Tom Schillue\r\n\r\nEpisode 258: Rich Vos and Tom Shillue join TACS to talk to Anthony about a past show they did together, who Bonnie is fucking now (kidding), Antâ€™s â€œgirl fightâ€ with Opie, hot chicks getting uglier, hot girl jobs, and showering (WTF?). They then discuss living with others, The Honeymooners, an Aussie Instagram gal, Tomâ€™s trips to the cemetery, the movie Exodus, binge watching, Fargo, Bloodline, Carly Fiorina and The View, raping and seducing, the hypocrisy that comes with speaking your mind, and Quentin Tarantino. We see a clip of Obama having some fun with the media, they chat about policy versus personality, the presidential candidates, Tom tells a Letterman story before exiting, and Ant and Rich go on to talk about working sober, TACS Network, stepping up your game, and Jimmy Fallonâ€™s drinking. They wrap the day talking about causes, â€œHERO,â€ bathroom segregation, campaign ads, tattoos, reinventing yourself, crazy cats, Christmas and Jews, Muslims in Germany, and being surrounded by enemies.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8d440401e35625f62f0602c27ace4f6aabfb3c7","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-11-03+Rich+Vos+Tom+Schillue+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8d440401e35625f62f0602c27ace4f6aabfb3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,212,64,64,30,53,98,95,98,240,96,44,39,172,228,246,170,191,179,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
