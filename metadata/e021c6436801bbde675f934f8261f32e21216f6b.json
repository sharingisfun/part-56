You can not control your subjects directly; instead you focus on city-building, resource management, diplomacy, heroes, magic and other things a\r\ntypical king deals with on a daily basis.\r\nThe game is very flexible: you can build up a powerful ream and rule the lands with an iron grip, or establish a humble fishermen's village. Or create a trading empire. Or found a small, bur well-defended outpost or raider's camp. Or become a host of a wizard's manor.\r\nAll characters, from a hauler to a hero have their own minds and behavior patterns. Sometimes it is interesting just to watch people scurry about minding their own business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e021c6436801bbde675f934f8261f32e21216f6b","amp;dn":"Hearthlands+v0.8.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e021c6436801bbde675f934f8261f32e21216f6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,33,198,67,104,1,187,222,103,95,147,79,130,97,243,46,33,33,111,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
