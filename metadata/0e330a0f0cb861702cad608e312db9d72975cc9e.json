The sole member of the project is Arachna â€“ also known from her activities in the Lily of the Valley band.\r\n\r\nWhile dark scene is rather egalitarian, it is still hard to find solo projects where a woman is responsible for both vocals and music production. Listening to Miranda Cartel we can only wish that more ladies take up synthesizers and DAW-s as well as microphones. The effects are both pleasing and professional.\r\n\r\nFind more music at halotan.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e330a0f0cb861702cad608e312db9d72975cc9e","amp;dn":"Miranda+Cartel+-+Divert+-+Synthpop+Futurepop+Dark+Electro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e330a0f0cb861702cad608e312db9d72975cc9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,51,10,15,12,184,97,112,44,173,96,142,49,45,185,215,41,117,204,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
