For context, this means that only Zappa's first four albums were available to the public at the time. Finally released some months before Zappa's death, it shows the early Mothers (Of Invention) moving in a more complex musical direction, setting the stage for the extended compositions of â€œUncle Meatâ€.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the set is a one-off performance of a musical play retrospectively entitled â€œProgress?â€, and featuring members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Zappa had been writing chamber music pieces in the hotel rooms he visited and wanted to try them out. He strung them together by devising a psychodrama he called &quot;Progress?&quot; This was meant (and indeed turned out) to be a one-time performance, so he made sure to record it.\r\n\r\nThe second half presents the rock part of that night's concert. All instrumental and very focused, it presents Zappa's best tunes from 1967-1968.\r\n \r\nA crucial document that fans of the '60s Mothers will enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa &amp; The Mothers of Invention\r\n\r\nfeaturing members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra\r\n\r\nAhead Of Their Time\r\n\r\n(Royal Festival Hall, London, England, October 25, 1968)\r\n\r\n1991\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCD / 1991 / VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\n\r\n1.\tPrologue 3:07\r\n2.\tProgress? 4:44\r\n3.\tLike It Or Not 2:21\r\n4.\tThe Jimmy Carl Black Philosophy Lesson 2:01\r\n5.\tHolding The Group Back (2:00\r\n6.\tHoliday In Berlin 0:56\r\n7.\tThe Rejected Mexican Pope Leaves The Stage 2:55\r\n8.\tUndaunted, The Band Plays On 4:34\r\n9.\tAgency Man 3:17\r\n10.\tEpilogue 1:52\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\n\r\n11.\tKing Kong 8:13\r\n12.\tHelp, I'm A Rock 1:38\r\n13.\tTransylvania Boogie 3:07\r\n14.\tPound For A Brown 6:50\r\n15.\tSleeping In A Jar 2:24\r\n16.\tLet's Make The Water Turn Black 1:51\r\n17.\tHarry, You're A Beast 0:53\r\n18.\tThe Orange County Lumber Truck (Part I) 0:47\r\n19.\tOh No 3:22\r\n20.\tThe Orange County Lumber Truck (Part II) 10:40\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa &amp; The Mothers of Invention\r\n\r\nfeaturing members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra\r\n\r\nAhead Of Their Time\r\n\r\n(Royal Festival Hall, London, England, October 25, 1968)\r\n\r\n1991\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b85aea27bb61a86309ebfbbb3e388f18568ea657","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Ahead+Of+Their+Time+%281991%29+%5BLondon%2C+1968%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b85aea27bb61a86309ebfbbb3e388f18568ea657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,90,234,39,187,97,168,99,9,235,251,187,62,56,143,24,86,142,166,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
