It is the sequel to the original Far Cry, a game produced by developer Crytek. It was released on October 21, 2008, in North America and on October 23, 2008, in Europe and Australia. It was made available on Steam on October 22, 2008. Crytek, the developer of the original Far Cry, was not involved in its development at all as it no longer owns the Far Cry franchise.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in an unnamed war-torn African country. The player assumes the role of a mercenary who is sent to the country to assassinate a notorious arms dealer known as The Jackal. When the mercenary contracts severe malaria and botches the assassination, he is forced into working for the warring factions, all-the-while battling his disease malaria and going on a quest to track The Jackal down.\r\n\r\nUbisoft marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to the previous Far Cry, despite the almost complete absence of any plot connections between the two games (beside The Jackal possibly being Jack Carver). Far Cry 2 instead features completely new characters and setting. It also features a new style of gameplay that allows the player to explore the different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The map is exactly 50 kmÂ² (only 19 kmÂ² are actually accessible, though). This is an astoundingly large play environment with amazing vista points. It is speculated to be based off Mali, what with its varied landscape, but also through the heavy use of Dogon architecture; the Dogon being indigenous to Mali. As of January 23, 2009, the game had sold 2.9 million copies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6328787776acd1debf0c08aa10be067d1da59b","amp;dn":"Far+cry+2+Repack+by+GGamer1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6328787776acd1debf0c08aa10be067d1da59b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,99,40,120,119,118,172,209,222,191,12,8,170,16,190,6,125,29,165,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
