Especially outstanding is Panis Angelicus, The Lord's Prayer and Ave Maria. But even White Christmas, which I have never particularly liked, is given a new and beautiful treatment.\r\n\r\nTheir voices range from soft and tender to a soaring cresendo,on all the songs. And I agree with Mr. Preiser, Carlos' voice is magnificant and provides the foundation for this wonderful, glorious music.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this album.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c636d74a645646721678fed835246b93b8eb287a","amp;dn":"Il+Divo+-+The+Christmas+Collection+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c636d74a645646721678fed835246b93b8eb287a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,54,215,74,100,86,70,114,22,120,254,216,53,36,107,147,184,235,40,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
