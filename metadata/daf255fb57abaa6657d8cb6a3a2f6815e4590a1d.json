Here, in a single, concise volume, is all that every art lover and student will ever want to know about the most popular and significant event in the history of painting. Some 300 entries cover not only the lives and careers of the main participants (painters, critics, patrons, dealers and collectors, as well as writers and musicians) but also techniques, prices and localities, and a wealth of information on the cultural, social and political background that helps to set Impressionism in context. Bernard Denvir's immensely useful book incorporates this new thinking and brings the story of Impressionism up to date. It also includes a chronology of events, a gazetteer of the major collections and a wealth of documentary illustrations and maps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf255fb57abaa6657d8cb6a3a2f6815e4590a1d","amp;dn":"Thames+and+Hudson+Encyclopaedia+of+British+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf255fb57abaa6657d8cb6a3a2f6815e4590a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,242,85,251,87,171,170,102,87,216,203,106,58,47,104,21,228,89,10,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
