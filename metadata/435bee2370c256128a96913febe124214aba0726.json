This technological - and commercial - success has been since emulated by other applications areas, with a tremendous amplification of innovation. This book describes the fundamentals and latest developments in microarray technology, as well as its future directions. It presents detailed overviews of the different techniques of fabricating microarrays, of the chemistries and preparative steps involved, of the different types of microarrays, and of the instrumentation and optical issues involved","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435bee2370c256128a96913febe124214aba0726","amp;dn":"Microarray+Technology+and+Its+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435bee2370c256128a96913febe124214aba0726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,91,238,35,112,194,86,18,138,150,145,63,235,225,36,33,74,186,7,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
