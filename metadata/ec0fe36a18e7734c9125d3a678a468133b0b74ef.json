Through a series of lively - often fiery - interviews, they examine the charge of anti-Semitism against Shakespeare, whose character Shylock remains one of the most odious and divisive fictional Jews in history.\r\nHow did the moneylender from Venice become such a useful propaganda tool in Nazi Germany? And how much of a liberty will Jacobson be taking when he uproots the action to modern-day Alderley Edge, and audaciously reinterprets the infamous 'pound of flesh'?\r\nInterviewees include Antony Sher, Anthony Julius and Stephen Greenblatt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec0fe36a18e7734c9125d3a678a468133b0b74ef","amp;dn":"imagine.Shylocks.Ghost.s25e01.EN.SUB.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec0fe36a18e7734c9125d3a678a468133b0b74ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,15,227,106,24,231,115,76,145,37,211,166,120,164,104,19,59,11,116,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
