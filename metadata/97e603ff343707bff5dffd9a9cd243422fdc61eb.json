But using the wrong framework, or wrongly using the right framework, can be costly. This concise book shares higher-level ideas around web development frameworks that govern HTML and CSS code, whether youâ€™re looking at an external option or planning to build your own.\r\n\r\nAuthor Jens Meiert outlines various principles, methods, and practices that you can use to make sure your framework has the functionality you need without bloated code to slow you down.\r\n\r\nChoose a framework that can be tailored and extended\r\nStick to framework ground rules: follow the documentation and donâ€™t overwrite framework code\r\nBuild a framework by means of a prototype: a static internal website that includes all the page types and elements you need\r\nFocus on quality assurance during the development process, and quality control to find and fix framework issues\r\nDiligently maintain and update your framework, whether itâ€™s for internal or external use\r\nAnchor your documentation right where development happens\r\nJens Oliver Meiert is a former senior developer and tech lead at Google, Aperto, and GMX, where he architected internal frameworks that married fast development with high quality code","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e603ff343707bff5dffd9a9cd243422fdc61eb","amp;dn":"The+Little+Book+of+HTMLCSS+Frameworks+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e603ff343707bff5dffd9a9cd243422fdc61eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,230,3,255,52,55,7,191,245,223,253,154,156,210,67,66,47,220,97,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
