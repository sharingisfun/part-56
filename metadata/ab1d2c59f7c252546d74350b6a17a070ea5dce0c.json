But that's about all they have in common. Ryan has spent the last decade in China building his career as a documentary photographer. Colin stayed closer to home, in Toronto, and built up his own successful currency trading company, which he recently resigned from. Together they have just completed a 65 day - 18,000km - motorcycle journey around China. They have traveled through some of the country's most populous and remote regions, while at the same time making a documentary film. The purpose of the film is to put China on display. To explore the visual and cultural wonders that is China. With a massive population, crowded cities, abundant minorities and its stunning natural landscape; China offers a traveler an experience like no other. And we're hoping you'll come along for the ride, on one of the world's greatest adventures. Our films title is: &quot;The Middle Kingdom Ride&quot;, as China's historical name was once &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  Shangri La to Shanghai \r\nThe closure of the Eastern Tibetan border forces the Pyle brothers to travel by plane reconnecting with their bikes in Shangri-La. From here they head to Guizhou province, but the improvement of the road tarmac and heavy rain make the road travel incredibly dangerous and Colin smashes his bike into a tree. Back on the road with new street tyres, Ryan and Colin make their way through the mystical karst landscape of Guilin and on to the manufacturing heartland of China before striking out for Shanghai, via Putoushan Island and the Yangshan Port, the biggest and busiest port in the world.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Tough-Rides-China-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3173 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 520 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2524222/?ref_=tt_ov_inf \nhttp://www.toughrides.tv/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1d2c59f7c252546d74350b6a17a070ea5dce0c","amp;dn":"Tough+Rides+China+Series+1+6of6+Shangri+La+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1d2c59f7c252546d74350b6a17a070ea5dce0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,29,44,89,247,194,82,84,109,116,53,11,106,23,160,112,234,93,206,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
