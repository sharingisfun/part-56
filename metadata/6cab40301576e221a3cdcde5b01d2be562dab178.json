Michael Nunn and William Trevitt (creators of award-winning programmes BalletBoyz/Strictly Bolshoi/BalletBoyz: The Rite of Spring) present backstage interviews with the dancers during the show, studio documentary footage of the creation, and brief insights into the evening's many collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe performance includes Liam Scarlett's work Serpent with Max Richter's music, and Russell Maliphant's award-winning work Fallen with music by Armand Amar, with both pieces performed to live music played by the BBC Concert Orchestra.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/10/31/e409c5a2b99bf31539c81b3341ebfa35.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cab40301576e221a3cdcde5b01d2be562dab178","amp;dn":"BalletBoyz.at.the.Roundhouse.EN.SUB.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cab40301576e221a3cdcde5b01d2be562dab178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,171,64,48,21,118,226,33,163,205,205,229,176,29,43,229,98,218,177,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
