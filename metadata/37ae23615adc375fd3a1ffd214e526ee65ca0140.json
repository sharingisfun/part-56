It deals with important topics hardly found in regular textbooks, including the Robertson-Schrodinger relation, incompatibility between angle and angular momentum, &quot;dispersed indeterminacy,&quot; interaction-free measurements, &quot;submissive quantum mechanics,&quot; and many others. With its in-depth discussion of key concepts complete with problems and exercises, this book is poised to become the standard textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate quantum mechanics courses and an essential reference for physics students and physics professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ae23615adc375fd3a1ffd214e526ee65ca0140","amp;dn":"Quantum+Mechanics+and+Quantum+Information","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ae23615adc375fd3a1ffd214e526ee65ca0140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,174,35,97,90,220,55,95,211,161,255,210,20,229,38,238,101,202,1,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
