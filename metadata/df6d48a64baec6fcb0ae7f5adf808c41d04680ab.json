When you win it, you will unlock all unique parts (also called Junkman parts). Get any car and put all the parts except performance. Once you have your car the way you desire, go to the performance shop. Max out your car. Then, put the Junkman parts on. Max out your car again. Then put on the Junkman parts again. Your car should be fully upgraded.\r\n\r\n  *Mo' Money -  When you're going to sell a car, always take it to the tune up shop and sell all the parts first. The selling price of the car is the same either way.\r\n\r\n  *Perfect Launch - Watch your tachometer when at the starting line. Get your needle in the blue right when the race starts to get a perfect launch and gain some time against your opponents.\r\n\r\n  *Start off with $40,000 - If you have Need for Speed: Underground 2 installed on your computer and you begin a New Career, you will start off with $40,000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df6d48a64baec6fcb0ae7f5adf808c41d04680ab","amp;dn":"Need+for+Speed+-+Most+Wanted+%282005%29+-+Complete+Direct+Play+-+No+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df6d48a64baec6fcb0ae7f5adf808c41d04680ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,109,72,166,75,174,198,252,176,174,127,90,223,128,140,65,208,70,128,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
