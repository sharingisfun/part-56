Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nSadly Kennedy's father has passed away. No episodes for 11.09, 11.10, and 11.11.\r\n\r\nKennedy starts the night off thanking her audience for the well wishes. She recently lost her father and really appreciates it. Quickly she moves on to the FBN debate and its fallout. She was very pleased with the moderators at FBN - but of course she would be, she works at FBN. (I agree with her though. They were good moderators.) Snarky comments, interruptions, and a pushy Kasich. Then she moves on to the best part of the night. Rand Paul going after Marco Rubio. &quot;How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?&quot; As expected there was more anti-immigrant rhetoric from Donald Trump. Apparently he's a big fan of Eisenhower's &quot;Operation Wetback&quot;.\r\n\r\nTrump is not backing down from his admiration of Eisenhower's mass deportation of immigrants. (Official called Operation Wetback.) ANTHONY CUMIA, BEN DOMENECH, and JOANNE NOSUCHINSKY are here to tell us what they think. Afterwards they move on to talking about Rand Paul's clash with Marco Rubio. Rand says Rubio isn't a real conservative for wanting to increase spending when we've already got an 18 trillion dollar debt. Rubio responds with this old chestnut, &quot;You're isolationist!&quot;\r\n\r\nGREG GUTFELD is here to talk about the recent outbreak of PC madness taking over at Yale and Missouri. Free Speech, Halloween costumes, safe spaces, resignation, and Gutfeld's new book &quot;I'm A Bouncy Boy.&quot;\r\n\r\nJeb Bush's campaign seems to be on the decline. PEGGY NOONAN is here to discuss. She talks her book, &quot;The Time of Our Lives&quot;, Jeb Bush's campaign, and the chance he'll actually win the presidency.\r\n\r\nEveryone is going after Carly Fiorina. Between the debate and Hillary cackling about a supporter choking her through the television she's had a hard couple weeks. Special guest COLIN QUINN joins the panel with ANTHONY CUMIA and JOANNE NOSUCHINSKY to discuss ... mostly Hillary. Afterwords they move onto Ben Carson's foreign policy missteps in the FBN debate.\r\n\r\nKennedy interviews COLIN QUINN one on one. He's starring in an off broadway play called &quot;The New York Story&quot;. Directed by Jerry Sienfeld. They talk about his play, the university of Missouri, and political correctness.\r\n\r\nThe blue collar comic RON WHITE is here to talk about his run for the presidency. He's running as an independent. RON WHITE 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name : Kennedy.2015.11.12.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media\r\nCodec ID : isom\r\nFile size : 252 MiB\r\nDuration : 41mn 59s\r\nOverall bit rate : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration : 41mn 59s\r\nBit rate : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth : 624 pixels\r\nHeight : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Variable\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.106\r\nStream size : 210 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 41mn 59s\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 38.4 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a61cde780a6df59903a35c74dc0afc2781664f0c","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.11.12.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a61cde780a6df59903a35c74dc0afc2781664f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,28,222,120,10,109,245,153,3,163,92,116,220,10,252,39,129,102,79,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
