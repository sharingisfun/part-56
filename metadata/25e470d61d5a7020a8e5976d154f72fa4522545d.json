He has led a privileged childhood, raised in a large estate nestled in the plains of the English countryside. He is in line to inherit his familyâ€™s property. That is, if he can fulfill his fatherâ€™s archaic wishes. Under the watchful eye of his cantankerous caretaker Ananias, Cecil is ordered to spend several months  working in the poverty stricken village of The Deverills. Intending to break him of his vanity and pride, instead his months at The Deverills introduce Cecil to a new infatuation - a beautiful village woman named Natalie. When he is forced to choose between her and his freedom, Cecil spends years chasing after his lost love, from the Boer War of Africa to the speakeasies of 1920â€™s New York City. In order to reunite with the woman he loves, Cecil may have to lose everything along the way.\r\n\r\nVideo Book Trailer Available on youtube:\n\r\nThank you for downloading my book.  :)\r\n\r\nI have tried my best to include most popular e-book formats for your convenience.\r\n\r\nI am a self-published author, this book is free to download and share with anyone you would like.\r\n \r\nMy website is http://ErinRitch.com\r\nMy blog can be found at http://NoWyverns.com\r\nI am also on twitter @ERitch324\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting independent artists like me.
