You see him just off your tail. The adrenalin hits you like a fist. You call your wingman: &quot;Viper One, I've got a bandit on my six. This is not good...&quot;\r\nYou go to afterburner and your Falcon jumps, slamming you back in the seat. The MiG 29 has just reached missile range... There! He's fired, the deadly rocket screams toward you, seeing nothing but the heat of your exhaust. Without thinking, you drop a series of flares hoping to confuse it, and yank back on the stick... 50 degrees... 80... over the top... your Head Up display shows you're pulling 9g's...\r\n...Nearly blacked out, you ease forward on the stick. The g's drop, and you can see again. There he is! You're on HIS six now. This is going to be sweet. As you get tone you know he's yours.\r\nFrom the very beginning the Falcon series has been acclaimed for its realism, pushing back the limits of what was thought possible for a comupter filght simulator back in the day.\r\nIt is as simple as that: the flight models are real, the terrain is real, the radar and weapons systems are real... And the threats are real. No phony weapons or magic bullets here... just the best civilian F-16 simulation available. You don't just play Falcon, you strap yourself in and get ready for battle.\r\nFlight characteristics and armament of the real F-16\r\nAdvanced electronics/radar systems\r\nThe terrain conforming precisely to military maps of the areas\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\n1.8 GHz Processor\r\n512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)\r\n3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)\r\n2GB HDD\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98375fda88f5932b579f9b9ffa468da2adc926ac","amp;dn":"Falcon+Collection+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98375fda88f5932b579f9b9ffa468da2adc926ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,55,95,218,136,245,147,43,87,159,155,159,250,70,141,162,173,201,38,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
