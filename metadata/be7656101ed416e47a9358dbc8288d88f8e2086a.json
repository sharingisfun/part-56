In the process, he has failed at practically everything, most of all as a parent to his son. After a brush with death, Melvin decides to use his powers for good and clean up the streets of New Orleans with the help of his best friend/definitely-not-a-sidekick, Lucille (Eddie Griffin). For a man who can do the impossible, it might be a fight even he canâ€™t win.\r\n\r\nDirector: Nick Love\r\n\r\nWriters: Nick Love\r\n\r\nActors: Stephen Dorff\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nRun Time: 1 hour 26 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7656101ed416e47a9358dbc8288d88f8e2086a","amp;dn":"American+Hero.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7656101ed416e47a9358dbc8288d88f8e2086a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,118,86,16,30,212,22,228,122,147,88,219,200,40,141,136,248,226,8,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
