She crossed the Sahara, charmed snakes in Marrakech and cycled the Adirondack mountains but her latest adventure is an interior one. It starts with the discovery that her house is built on a crypt full of human skeletons. Facing her fear of these strangers' bones takes her to other charnel houses in Europe and on a journey into the meaning of bones themselves. This exploration, though it began before her diagnosis with an inoperable sarcoma, takes on a new significance when the question of living well in the face of mortality abruptly ceases to be hypothetical.\r\n\r\nA Tour of Bones is a passionate testament to the conviction that living is more than not dying, and that contemplating mortality is not about being prepared to die but about being prepared to live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb8bc5aa4ac61839875142001e975ad6268d0e3","amp;dn":"A+Tour+of+Bones+-+Denise+Inge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb8bc5aa4ac61839875142001e975ad6268d0e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,184,188,90,164,172,97,131,152,117,20,32,1,233,117,173,98,104,208,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
