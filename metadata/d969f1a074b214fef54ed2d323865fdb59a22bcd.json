Sparta is run by well-known local character Francis Jones, who has given behind-the-scenes access to himself, his staff and their operations.\r\n\r\nFrancis is a born again Christian and former professional boxer. He is a man with a big personality and he's on a mission to clean up the streets of Darlington. No job is too small for Sparta Security and Francis often goes the extra mile to help his clients with often outrageous but also hilarious consequences.\r\n\r\nFrancis relies on his office team Rachel and Claire who use their unusual sales techniques to help him find and secure new business. The work they bring in varies from mediating in neighbourhood disputes to guarding against grand larceny at big businesses in the area. Francis employs a number of security staff to work with him including balaclava-clad ex-forces officers, part-time bouncers and a personal trainer, and together they use a range of unorthodox methods to make Darlington a better place to live.\r\n\r\nA sensitive case puts Francis under pressure when he's hired to guard the house of a local woman who has had a domestic violence protection order taken out against her former husband. Francis, who knows both parties, finds himself in the middle and trying to secure a peaceful outcome.\r\n\r\nApprentice Pembow is struggling to hit his sales targets so Francis hires an expert to give his newest recruit a sales masterclass. Pembow then has to prove he has paid attention by pitching to a potential client. Elsewhere, Francis and Rachel fall out over an office clear-out, requiring more diplomacy from Francis to keep all his staff smiling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d969f1a074b214fef54ed2d323865fdb59a22bcd","amp;dn":"Rent.a.Cop.s01e05.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d969f1a074b214fef54ed2d323865fdb59a22bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,105,241,160,116,178,20,254,245,78,210,211,35,134,95,219,89,162,43,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
