Their music was a fusion of alternative rock and heavy metal, as their songs cover a variety of styles, ranging from heavy and upbeat, such as their 2005 single &quot;Blamethrower&quot; to slower, more melodic songs such as their 2004 single &quot;Moving to Blackwater&quot;. The former style of song often featured vocalist Jamie Lenman switching between shouting and whispering, a technique often used in heavy metal and post-hardcore music. \r\n\r\nThe band gained respect in the UK underground music scene, and were known for the devotion to their fans and their fans' devotion to the band. Reuben never achieved mainstream success, due to never charting in the UK Top 40, but still gained minor achievement by charting four singles in the UK Singles Chart. their highest charting single being 2004's &quot;Freddy Kreuger&quot; that reached UK No. 53.\r\n\r\nIn June 2008, Reuben entered a state of indefinite hiatus. Fans were emailed by the band manager, making them aware of the hiatus, assuring them that this was not the end for Reuben.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbums In This Compilation\r\n\r\nThis is rough and its in multiple bitrates from 320cbr VBR and 128k \r\n\r\n Racecar Is Racecar Backwards - June 2004 \r\n  \r\n Very Fast Very Dangerous - September 2005\r\n   \r\n In Nothing We Trust - 25 June 2007\r\n \r\n Pilot EP - January 2001\r\n\r\n Betrayed Demo - 1999 \r\n\r\n Singles and other Random Pieces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b73b8d04d31f588a64f148ca500cc327244f2e19","amp;dn":"Reuben+1999-2007+VBR+ak6103+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b73b8d04d31f588a64f148ca500cc327244f2e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,59,141,4,211,31,88,138,100,241,72,202,80,12,195,39,36,79,46,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
