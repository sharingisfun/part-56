We leeched the DVDRip to compare and here's our\nobservations between the two:\n\n-The DVD has more picture on the top and bottom, while the HDTV copy has more on the left and right. we stuck a comparison image in our sample dir.\n-The HDTV copy is clearer\n-The DVD was encoded at 29fps while the recording was clearly 23fps...although there's time time compression blends\n-The HDTV copy is cut for time (not to mention has a monster bitrate)\n\nSo pick and choose. If you like to collect Fraggle Rock, here's a shitty &quot;remastered&quot; widescreen version for ya.\n\nBTW: Some guides say &quot;The Bells of Fraggle Rock&quot; is S03E01 whereas Wikipedia and FFNDVD tagged it as S03E22 - Fraggle.Rock.S03E22.DVDRip.XviD-FFNDVD\nS03E01 is the correct one, so we're tagging it so...\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, we're going to internal this and the 720p copy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f98812eca404321861d0f7ab508c123105f609","amp;dn":"Fraggle.Rock.S03E01.iNTERNAL.READNFO.HDTV.x264-REGRET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f98812eca404321861d0f7ab508c123105f609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,249,136,18,236,164,4,50,24,97,208,247,171,80,140,18,49,5,246,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
