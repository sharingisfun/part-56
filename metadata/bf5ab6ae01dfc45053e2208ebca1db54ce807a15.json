A massive rebuild of a tank destroyer and the fierce Quad 50 mobile machine gun. An epic cross-continent hunt for an ultra-rare rifle and an operational flamethrower. Military history buff Paul Shull is on a mission to touch, hold, and fire some of the greatest pieces of weaponry on the planet. Get an up-close look at some of the most iconic weapons of the last 150 years and witness the awesome firepower they still have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  Nazi Assault Rifle \r\nTo military history collectors, it's the rarest of all machine guns. The FG-42 assault rifle, designed specifically for German World War II paratroopers, is so rare that they now sell for thousands of dollars at auctions. It's considered almost unattainable, but that doesn't stop host Paul Shull from attempting to not only find one but to pull its trigger as well. Join him on this impossible quest as he reaches outside his usual network of collectors to find this innovative weapon and see if it lives up to its mythic reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f4/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/The-Weapon-Hunter-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CAVLC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3187 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 46mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/the-weapon-hunter/1003807","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5ab6ae01dfc45053e2208ebca1db54ce807a15","amp;dn":"The+Weapon+Hunter+Series+1+4of6+Nazi+Assault+Rifle+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5ab6ae01dfc45053e2208ebca1db54ce807a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,90,182,174,1,223,196,80,83,226,32,142,188,161,219,84,206,128,122,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
