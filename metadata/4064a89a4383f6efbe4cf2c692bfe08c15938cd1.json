Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Ryan Doon\r\n\r\nEpisode 260: TACS week ends with casual Anthony chatting it up about doing Artie Langeâ€™s podcast, an adventure he and KtC had, public transportation, recent TV and movie watching, Thomas Edison being a lump of shit, and he plays Russian picture roulette with his phone. Ryan Doon takes a seat at the desk to talk with Ant about almost becoming a nurse, being in bands, being a â€œVine star,â€ getting paid for endorsements, Vine paying the bills, pulling tail from Vine, being rapey, and growing up with three sisters. They also discuss using comedy as a crutch, lying about your age, on-line comments, Marc Maron, staying away from controversy, internet celebrities, skinny shaming, Essena O'Neill, and teenage angst. They then get into Ben Carsonâ€™s rap song, we see a â€œDeport Racismâ€ ad, they talk about a Blazing Saddles animated feature, an armed robberâ€™s family complaint, Boston â€œthugs,â€ sex with robots, robot rape, the book Ryan was working on, Tamar Braxton, and the interview with the dude who beat up an Uber dude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4064a89a4383f6efbe4cf2c692bfe08c15938cd1","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-11-05+Ryan+Doon+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4064a89a4383f6efbe4cf2c692bfe08c15938cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,100,168,154,67,131,246,239,190,76,242,198,146,191,224,140,21,147,140,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
