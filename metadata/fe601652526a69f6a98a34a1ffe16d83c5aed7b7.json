In the early stages of Blitzkrieg's career they regularly produced gigs in England, but then later split in 1981. Brian Ross most notably went on to join Satan, another metal band, along with stints in Avenger, Lone Wolf and Unter den Linden. In 1984 Ross and fellow founding member Jim Sirotto, along with guitarist Mick Proctor (ex-Tygers of Pan Tang), bass player Mick Moore (of Avenger) and drummer Sean Taylor (Satan/Blind Fury, ex-Raven) then decided that it was time to record the Blitzkrieg album that was originally planned to be released in 1981, A Time of Changes. It was later released in 1985.\r\n\r\nBlitzkrieg released 10 Years of Blitzkrieg in 1991. The released Unholy Trinity in 1995. The album Ten was released in 1997. The Mists of Avalon was released in 1998.\r\n\r\nRoss was then involved in a car accident, which temporarily kept Blitzkrieg from playing. After he recovered, the band released the albums, Absolute Power (a studio album), Absolutely Live (a live album) and Sins and Greed. On 10 August 2007, Blitzkrieg released their album Theatre of the Damned through their record label Armageddon Music.\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 2015\r\nCountry: Uk\r\nGenre: Heavy Metal \r\nCodec: Mp3\r\nBitrate: 320Kbps\r\nSize: 143 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n1.
