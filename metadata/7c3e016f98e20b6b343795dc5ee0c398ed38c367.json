It addresses modern trends such as pharmacogenomics, evaluation of gene expression, recombinant proteins from methylotrophic yeast, identification of novel fermentation inhibitors of bioethanol production, and polyhydroxyalkanoate based biomaterials. The book highlights the practical utility of biotechnology and bioinformatics for bioenergy, production of high value biochemicals, modeling molecular interactions, drug discovery, and personalized medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3e016f98e20b6b343795dc5ee0c398ed38c367","amp;dn":"Biotechnology+and+Bioinformatics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3e016f98e20b6b343795dc5ee0c398ed38c367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,62,1,111,152,226,11,107,52,55,149,220,94,224,195,152,237,56,195,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
