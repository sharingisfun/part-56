It is intended to serve the research needs of both academic and industrial scientists, including chemical or mechanical engineers, material and surface scientists, physical chemists, chemical and biophysicists, rheologists, physiochemical hydrodynamicists, and applied mathematicians (especially those with interests in viscous fluid mechanics and continuum mechanics).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a textbook it provides materials for a one- or two-semester graduate-level course in interfacial transport processes. It may also be noted that, while separate practical and theoretical subdivisions of material have been introduced, a kind of cross-emphasis is often stressed: (i) to the academic scientist, or the importance of understanding major applications of interfacial transport; and (ii) to the industrial scientist, of the importance of understanding the underlying theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1e6f2428209e1cca21cc0de00ad2f8ffbcd6b3","amp;dn":"Interfacial+Transport+Processes+and+Rheology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d1e6f2428209e1cca21cc0de00ad2f8ffbcd6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,30,111,36,40,32,158,28,202,33,204,13,224,10,210,248,255,188,214,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
