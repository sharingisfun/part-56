The game's epic story may drive you toward your ultimate end-goal, but how you get there is entirely up to you.\r\nOr up to you and a friend, because Divinity: Original Sin can be played completely cooperatively, and features both online and local drop-in/drop-out multiplayer.

Explore many different environments, fight all kinds of fantastical creatures and discover tons of desirable items.\r\nExperience gripping party- and turn-based combat.

Make decisions together (or disagree entirely), as your interactions and relationship with your partner influence the game.\r\nUnravel a deep and epic story, set in the early days of the Divinity universe. No prior experience with other Divinity games is necessary, however. The game takes place well before its predecessors, Divine Divinity and Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga, but will still feel familiar to fans.\r\nClassless character creation lets you design the character of your choice. Endless item interaction and combinations take exploration and experimentation to another level of freedom.\r\nCreate your own adventures and share them online.
