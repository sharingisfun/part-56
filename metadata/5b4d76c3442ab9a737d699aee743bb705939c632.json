There's no goal in this game. You need to decide the goal for yourself. It's the same as in life. This is an amazingly realistic simulator.\r\n\r\nUpdates for the game will come every so often.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nYou are the little girl.\r\nGreet dangerous strangers with a polite bow.\r\nUse wall kicks to reach areas the developer never intended you to go.\r\n\r\nDEADFACTORY is operated by Shinda, a doujin game developer.\r\nWebsite: deadfactory.net\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThe buggy physics engine will cause both the little girl and the guys to flip out. Please be aware of this point.\r\n64-bit Windows operating system compatible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4d76c3442ab9a737d699aee743bb705939c632","amp;dn":"Yohjo+Simulator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4d76c3442ab9a737d699aee743bb705939c632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,77,118,195,68,42,185,167,55,214,153,174,231,67,187,112,89,57,198,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
