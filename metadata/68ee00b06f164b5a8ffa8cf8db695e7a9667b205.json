The real challenge is going to be getting the savegame exploit onto the OG Xbox Memory Card.  \r\n \r\n3 different methods can be found here: \r\n  \nhttp://www.biline.ca/xbox_ndure.htm\r\n \r\n \r\nGet the save game on your Memory Card\r\nUsing an Action Replay or GameShark USB Memory card writer click Here\r\nUsing an Xbox Controller and a PC click Here\r\nUsing a USB Flash Memory Stick click Here\r\n\r\n^This section is about 3/4 down the page in the link I provided. Alternatively, it's easiest to do this via an already modded xbox as you can copy it to the system via FTP and then copy it to a memory card from there","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ee00b06f164b5a8ffa8cf8db695e7a9667b205","amp;dn":"Original+Xbox+Softmod+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ee00b06f164b5a8ffa8cf8db695e7a9667b205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,238,0,176,111,22,75,90,143,250,140,248,219,105,94,122,150,103,178,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
