If you're using MPC-HC (recommended), go to File &gt; Load Subtitle... or simply drag the srt into the player when the movie is on.\r\n\t  \r\nBONUS FEATURES:\r\nThe Gore The Merrier featurette (&quot;making of&quot;)\r\nCommentary (audio track)\r\nTheatrical Trailer\r\nEvil Dead: Hail To The King video game preview\r\nStill galleries\r\nTalent bios\r\n \r\n \r\nThis Anchor Bay release is the only one that contains the original full-frame video as it was shot. This is from the Limited Edition tin, but the standard equivalent (2000 R1 US Anchor Bay Evil Dead II Standard DVD) is supposed to be the same thing in a different package. No other releases are known to have the original open matte aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nI provide this specially to Evil Dead enthusiasts who may have a hard time getting their hands on this retail copy. I believe everyone should have the right to see this movie in its full uncropped glory. The menus have also been preserved.\r\n\r\nThis DVD was also released with the ever so prevalent widescreen cropped video, which was removed to save space and allow for an easy old-school burning to that 4.7GB blank DVD you have rotting in your drawner. Burn this baby with a tool like CloneDVD and go watch it in a cabin.\r\n\r\nFor more info visit the fan site http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/evil_dead_2_dvd.html\r\nI am not affiliated with the website in any way other than being a fan myself.\r\n\r\nHave a groovy one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:640f903d52503f2a27f3639ba434ccd7a415c988","amp;dn":"Evil+Dead+II+%281987%29+Limited+Edition+fullscreen+DVD+original+4%3A3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"640f903d52503f2a27f3639ba434ccd7a415c988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,15,144,61,82,80,63,42,39,243,99,155,164,52,204,215,164,21,201,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
