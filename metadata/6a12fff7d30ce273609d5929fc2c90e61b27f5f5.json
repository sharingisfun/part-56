The hook is irresistible: itâ€™s the near future, a time when love has long since been identified as a disease called amor deliria nervosa, and 17-year-old Lena is 95 days away from the operation that everyone gets to cure themselves. Can you feel the swoon coming? Enter Alex, a rakish daredevil who, as it turns out, is one of the Invalidsâ€”a tribe of uncured who live on the lam in the surrounding wilderness. With the clock ticking down to her surgery, Lena is drawn into Alexâ€™s world, one of passion and freedom, while her emotionally castrated family members hope to turn her into yet another complacent zombie. Oliverâ€™s masterstroke is making a strong case for love as disease: the anxiety, depression, insomnia, and impulsive behavior of the smitten do smack of infirmity. The story bogs down as it revels in romanceâ€”Alex is standard-issue perfectionâ€”but the book never loses its A Clockwork Orangeâ€“style bite regarding safety versus choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a12fff7d30ce273609d5929fc2c90e61b27f5f5","amp;dn":"Lauren+Oliver+-+Delirium+%28Delirium+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a12fff7d30ce273609d5929fc2c90e61b27f5f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,18,255,247,211,12,226,115,96,157,89,41,252,44,144,230,27,39,245,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
