Roselli, Kenneth R. Diller (Springer, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781441981189\r\n\r\nBiotransport: Principles and Applications is written primarily for biomedical engineering and bioengineering students at the introductory level, but should prove useful for anyone interested in quantitative analysis of transport in living systems. It is important that bioengineering students be exposed to the principles and subtleties of transport phenomena within the context of problems that arise in living systems. These tend to have constitutive properties, compositions, and geometries that are quite distinct from those of typical inanimate systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7501071ae9131f68601edd21dfaf5bcd63ff5f78","amp;dn":"Biotransport+Principles+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7501071ae9131f68601edd21dfaf5bcd63ff5f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,1,7,26,233,19,31,104,96,30,221,33,223,175,91,205,99,255,95,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
