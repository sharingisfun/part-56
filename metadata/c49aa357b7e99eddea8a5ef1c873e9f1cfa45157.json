Belanger (Blackwell, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781405156493\r\n\r\nBiotechnology can deliver complex flavors both as fermentation products and single constituents. Recent developments in transgenic research have spawned numerous studies in the use of metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways to produce high-value secondary metabolites that can enhance the flavors of food products. Biotechnology is also playing an increasingly important role in the breeding of food crops for enhanced flavor. This book provides a unique overview of the current state of the art of flavor production through biotechnology, examining the principles and current methods of producing flavors from plants and other organisms. Chapters are included on plant tissue culture, genetic engineering of plants for flavor improvement and genetic engineering of bacteria and fungi for flavor improvement of fermented beverages and dairy products. The book is directed at food scientists and technologists in the food and flavour industries as well as academics and ingredients suppliers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49aa357b7e99eddea8a5ef1c873e9f1cfa45157","amp;dn":"Biotechnology+in+Flavor+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49aa357b7e99eddea8a5ef1c873e9f1cfa45157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,154,163,87,183,233,158,221,234,138,94,241,200,115,233,241,207,164,81,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
