They are an excellent illustration of what's going on\r\ntoday in the vibrant European improv-jazz scene.\r\n\r\nThough only a quintet they have a deceptively large sound thanks to Zanussi's\r\neffective compositional use of a three-horn frontline and the interaction the\r\nthree get going on this set. Kjetil Moster gets some good sounds on tenor,\r\nsoprano and clarinet; Jorgen Mathisen expands the sound with his tenor and\r\nclarinet; and Eirik Hegdal rounds it all out on baritone and clarinet. As a\r\nclarinet trio they sound very striking but the various combinations via\r\ndoubling give us plenty of additional sound color variations which Zanussi puts\r\nto very good use. The rhythm section has drive and presence with Per of course\r\nplaying a central pivotal role on bass, riffing, improvising and anchoring\r\neverything very well. Gard Nilssen has a vibrant and swinging presence on\r\ndrums.\r\n\r\nThe compositional routines are invigorating, with the three-horn lines defining\r\nthe sound well and the individual soloing communicating nicely as do the\r\ninteractive three-ways that come to the forefront now and again. I like\r\nespecially Hegdal's baritone acrobatics, but everybody sounds quite good.\r\n\r\nThe music has an original feel, an accomplished togetherness and\r\nindividuality. Zanussi writes some beautiful charts. It is new jazz of real\r\nstature! I heartily recommend you hear this.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Antonio Poscic \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/02/zanussi-five-live-in-coimbra-clean-feed.html\r\n\r\nBy Glenn Astarita \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/live-in-coimbra-per-zanussi-clean-feed-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php\r\n\r\nBy Bill Meyer\r\n\r\nAv.
