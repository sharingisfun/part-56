Her mother has died trying to save children in a kindergarten, her seriously-injured younger sister is brought to a hospital, and Ngoc Ha encounters a variety of strangers as she wanders the war-torn streets of Hanoi looking for her father.\r\n\r\nA great classic of Vietnamese cinema, filmed in Hanoi amidst the smoke and rubble of the actual 1972 Christmas bombardment. One of the most remarkable movies ever made anywhere during wartime - full of exquisite and startling images - which offers a rare view of Hanoi during the Vietnam War. It was produced in 1973 by veteran director Hai Ninh and won the Golden Lotus honour for best feature film at the Vietnam Film Festival in 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 716x468, 23.976 fps, 1850 Kbps, 01h12m14s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Vietnamese audio, English subtitles hardcoded\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/dkkl2dmdr/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ed6xoiy4f/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/o980o63wf/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/52utkznen/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/kn27bixj3/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0624e919eeaac7a337b17fcdb903d11f1126c5","amp;dn":"Em+be+Ha+Noi+-+The+Little+Girl+of+Hanoi+%281975+-+Vietnam%29+war","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0624e919eeaac7a337b17fcdb903d11f1126c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,6,36,233,25,238,170,199,163,55,177,127,205,185,3,209,31,17,38,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
