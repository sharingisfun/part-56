Itâ€™s called Nothing Can Turn Into A Void and focuses on the British artist Vicki Bennett and her project People Like Us. Her work takes you on a journey into a world where literally anything can happen. Using her skills as an editor and a great sense of humor, she lets you roam through a world of imagination filled with contrasts and chance encounters between the past and the present. In performances, video work, music and collages, Bennett conveys that nothing is really what it seems.\r\n\r\nNothing can turn into a void â€“ An Art Apart: People Like Us (Sweden, 2015, 58 mins)\r\n\r\nMusic by People Like Us. Edited by Henrik MÃ¸ll &amp; Vicki Bennett. Sound mix by Andrew McKenzie. Produced by Jakob Abrahamsson.
