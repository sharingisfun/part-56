Others like Olivier Messiaen, Heitor Villa-Lobos and William Walton have left us significant, although limited, editions. All too many, however, have merely left us a mere fraction of their output and it was to bring these recordings to the record-buying public that the EMI Classics series COMPOSERS IN PERSON was planned and researched by Ken Jagger (1945-2007). He did include representative issues for five the above named composers in the series so as to provide a total of 20 releases.\r\n\r\nMost composers are found as either conductors or pianists (so sometimes both) although some appear on other instruments â€“ Hindemith as violist as well as conductor and Messiaen, Widor, Vierne and DuprÃ© as organist.\r\n \nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/composers-in-person/16175696#\r\n \nhttp://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/EMI/2175752","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e77811419e5d259b9eb366fcc11ca3fbcdbf24cb","amp;dn":"Composers+in+Person+EMI%3A+2175752+%5B2008%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e77811419e5d259b9eb366fcc11ca3fbcdbf24cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,120,17,65,158,93,37,155,158,179,102,252,193,28,163,251,205,191,36,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
