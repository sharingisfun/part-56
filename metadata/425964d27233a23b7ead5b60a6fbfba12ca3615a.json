Weeks of lively auditions, gruelling boot camps and nerve-jangling live shows come to a head over the next two nights. The act with the lowest public-vote figures will face an early exit from the contest this evening, bowing out in third place. By the end of tomorrow evening, one of the two remaining acts will claim their place in the spotlight as this year's winner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 12-Dec-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425964d27233a23b7ead5b60a6fbfba12ca3615a","amp;dn":"The+X+Factor+UK+S12E27+HDTV.x264-AwesomeDL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425964d27233a23b7ead5b60a6fbfba12ca3615a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,89,100,210,114,51,162,59,126,173,91,96,166,251,251,161,44,163,97,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
