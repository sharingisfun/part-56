The present volume offers a clear description of the various neutron-scattering techniques currently being used to answer biologically relevant questions. Their utility is illustrated through examples by some of the leading researchers in the field of neutron scattering. This volume will be a reference for researchers and a step-by-step guide for young scientists entering the field and the advanced graduate student","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013d9ac6437492930237335bbb79977823a98f06","amp;dn":"Neutron+Scattering+in+Biology+-+Techniques+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013d9ac6437492930237335bbb79977823a98f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,61,154,198,67,116,146,147,2,55,51,91,187,121,151,120,35,169,143,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
