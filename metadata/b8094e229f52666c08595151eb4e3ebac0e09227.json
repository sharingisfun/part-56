Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Gavin McInnes\r\n\r\nEpisode 280: We end TACS week with a once again made-up Ant drooling over the hot chicks over at Fox News, Gavin comes in to reenact a shitty snafu he had at Fox News, the guys chat about â€œChuck and Buck,â€ game changing sexual experiences, cunt positioning, past fuckery, haggard and trashy gals, Antâ€™s ex, severing the ties to your dick, and girl simulators. We take a look at a celebrity â€œending gun violenceâ€ PSA, Ant discusses presidential candidate shenanigans, â€œnow whatâ€ moments, Canadian gun violence PSAâ€™s, he plays a major downer of a texting and driving PSA, and we also see a video of pizza eating bitch that doesnâ€™t give a fuck about a NY city accident. Anthony takes a couple of calls regarding Republican voting and makeshift memorials, we get a Rat/Hanukkah update, hear from a few more callers, realize that Ant canâ€™t dress himself, look at Trump and his friend (not) Uncle Sam the eagle, and watch a rap video thatâ€™s utterly douche chilling. Ant talks about an unfortunate wood chipper (whatâ€™s that?) story, college students hating free speech, Navy women being secretly filmed, the Golden Globe nominees, Mohammad Ali defending Islam, the buyer of the Wu Tang album being a prick, and Ringo Star selling off shit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8094e229f52666c08595151eb4e3ebac0e09227","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-10+Gavin+McInnes+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8094e229f52666c08595151eb4e3ebac0e09227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,9,78,34,159,82,102,108,8,89,81,81,235,78,62,186,192,224,146,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
