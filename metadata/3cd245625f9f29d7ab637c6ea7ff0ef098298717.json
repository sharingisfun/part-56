This is the day I saw for the first time the green of the trees and the blue of the skies. This was the day when first time I opened my eyes and saw God alaround.Of course the word God didn't exist at that moment, but what I saw was God.I was thinking what should I give it to you today,then I rememebered a saying of Buddha:\r\n&quot;Sabba danam dhamma danam jinati&quot;-Buddha. The gift of Truth excends all of the gifts.
