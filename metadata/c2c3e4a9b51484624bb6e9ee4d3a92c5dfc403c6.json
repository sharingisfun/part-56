After the chase, where he saw Marshal Cain (Emile Meyer) get killed, he can't say &quot;no&quot; when the town asks him to take over the Marshal's duties. However, that same town starts to turn against him when he takes his new duties seriously by arresting and testifying against the killer... a boy, Eddie 'The Kid' Campbell (Robert Vaughn), who grew up in this town and comes from a broken home, garnering the sympathy of the townsfolk, who'd rather believe one of the other escaped bank robbers shot the sheriff. This is compounded by his daughter, who still has a crush on Eddie, even though after his mother died two years ago, he left town with not a word to her since. She, too, is convinced that Eddie is still that good little boy everyone remembers, and can't believe he's been changed, by his new life of riding with outlaws.\r\n \r\nSinopse Pt Br\r\n\r\nQuando o jovem Eddie foi para uma cidade com sua gangue para roubar um banco, foi preso e condenado. Ao sair da cadeia, o delegado Ben ajudou-o a tornar-se um cidadÃ£o de bem. Anos depois, a antiga gangue volta para roubar o mesmo banco, e atira no delegado.
