The teams have never met in the top tier of English football, and will be playing each other for the first time since the 2010-11 season, when Saints beat the Cherries twice in League One, having also knocked them out of the League Cup.\r\n\r\nThe day's other game saw struggling Sunderland visit Everton. The Black Cats won 2-0 at Goodison Park in May, a victory which dragged them out of the relegation zone. With another survival battle already seeming likely, they will be hoping for a similar result","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ffe99517e82b033c9bc5a68a2aacabc6b52ac9","amp;dn":"EPL+-+Match+of+the+Day+Two+01.11.2015+SD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ffe99517e82b033c9bc5a68a2aacabc6b52ac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,255,233,149,23,232,43,3,60,155,197,166,138,42,172,171,198,181,42,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
