But what if everyone is wrong?\r\n\r\nIn their acclaimed bestseller The Challenger Sale, Matthew Dixon and his colleagues at CEB busted many longstanding myths about sales. Now theyâ€™ve\r\nturned their research and analysis to a new vital business subjectâ€”customer loyaltyâ€”with a new book that turns the conventional wisdom on its head.\r\n\r\nThe idea that companies must delight customers by exceeding service expectations is so entrenched that managers rarely even question it. They devote untold time, energy, and resources to trying to dazzle people and inspire their undying loyalty. Yet CEBâ€™s careful research over five years and tens of thousands of respondents proves that the â€œdazzle factorâ€ is wildly overratedâ€”it simply doesnâ€™t predict repeat sales, share of wallet, or positive wordof-mouth. The reality:\r\n\r\nLoyalty is driven by how well a company delivers on its basic promises and solves day-to-day problems, not on how spectacular its service experience might be. Most customers donâ€™t want to be â€œwowedâ€; they want an effortless experience. And they are far more likely to punish you for bad service than to reward you for good service.\r\n\r\nIf you put on your customer hat rather than your manager or marketer hat, this makes a lot of sense. What do you really want from your cable company, a free month of HBO when it screws up or a fast, painless restoration of your connection? What about your bankâ€”do you want free cookies and a cheerful smile, even a personal relationship with your teller? Or just a quick in-and-out transaction and an easy way to get a refund when it accidentally overcharges on fees?\r\n\r\nThe Effortless Experience takes readers on a fascinating journey deep inside the customer experience to reveal what really makes customers loyalâ€”and disloyal. The authors lay out the four key pillars of a low-effort customer experience, along the way delivering robust data, shocking insights and profiles of companies that are already using the principles revealed by CEBâ€™s research, with great results. And they include many tools and templates you can start applying right away to improve service, reduce costs, decrease customer churn, and ultimately generate the elusive loyalty that the â€œdazzle factorâ€ fails to deliver.\r\n\r\nThe rewards are there for the taking, and the pathway to achieving them is now clearly marked.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                         .:.Shailab.:.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t     https://thepiratebay.la/user/shailab/\r\n\r\n      \t\t\t\t  https://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e616cff4c531881d22e14c57054d311b48ce24","amp;dn":"The+Effortless+Experience+by+Matthew+Dixon+and+Nick+Toman+%28shail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e616cff4c531881d22e14c57054d311b48ce24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,230,22,207,244,197,49,136,29,34,225,76,87,5,77,49,27,72,206,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
