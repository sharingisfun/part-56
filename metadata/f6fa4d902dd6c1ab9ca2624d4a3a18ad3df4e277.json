With some 85 examples and 150 problems, it covers the three important material classes of ceramics, polymers, and metals in a didactic manner. The renowned author surveys mechanical material behavior at both the introductory and advanced level, providing reading incentive to both students as well as specialists in such disciplines as materials science, chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering. This book is backed by five appendices on symbols, abbreviations, data sheets, materials properties, statistics and a summary of contact mechanics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6fa4d902dd6c1ab9ca2624d4a3a18ad3df4e277","amp;dn":"Structure%2C+Deformation%2C+and+Integrity+of+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6fa4d902dd6c1ab9ca2624d4a3a18ad3df4e277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,250,77,144,45,214,193,171,156,162,98,77,74,58,24,173,61,244,226,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
