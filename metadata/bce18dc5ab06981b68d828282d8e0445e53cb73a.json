Arguably, however, not one does a better job than this of illustrating just how powerful that breakthrough was (and the follow-through as well), and how absolutely the odd-eyed boy from Brixton changed the face of British pop. Beginning in the summer of 1972, when &quot;Starman&quot; revived the fortunes of the former one-hit (&quot;Space Oddity&quot;) wonder, Bowie released one of the most commanding sequences of 45s in British chart history, a run that not only included some of the finest records in his repertoire (&quot;John, I'm Only Dancing,&quot; &quot;The Jean Genie,&quot; &quot;Drive-In Saturday,&quot; &quot;Rebel Rebel,&quot; &quot;Fame&quot;), but also reached back into his pre-fame catalog for the occasional space-filler -- &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was already two years old when it made the U.K. Top Three in 1973. All are here, with the sequence filled out with some genuinely significant B-sides, none more so than &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Suffragette City,&quot; both of which would have made great A-sides in their own right. On through the '70s and '80s the collection goes, adopting a more populist approach for Bowie's latter-day career","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce18dc5ab06981b68d828282d8e0445e53cb73a","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+The+Singles+1969+to+1993+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce18dc5ab06981b68d828282d8e0445e53cb73a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,225,141,197,171,6,152,27,104,216,40,40,45,142,4,69,229,60,183,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
