Salar et al. (Springer, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9788132216827\r\n\r\nBiotechnology: Prospects and Applications covers the review of recent developments in biotechnology and international authorship presents global issues that help in our understanding of the role of biotechnology in solving important scientific and societal problems for the benefit of mankind and environment. A balanced coverage of basic molecular biology and practical applications, relevant examples, colored illustrations, and contemporary applications of biotechnology provide students and researchers with the tools and basic knowledge of biotechnology. In our effort to introduce students and researchers to cutting edge techniques and applications of biotechnology, we dedicated specific chapters to such emerging areas of biotechnology as Emerging Dynamics of Brassinosteroids Research, Third generation green energy, Bioremediation, Metal Organic Frameworks: New smart materials for biological application, Bioherbicides, Biosensors, Fetal Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Animal forensics. Biotechnology: Prospects and Applications will be highly useful for students, teachers and researchers in all disciplines of life sciences, agricultural sciences, medicine, and biotechnology in universities, research stations and biotechnology companies. The book features broader aspects of the role of biotechnology in human endeavor. It also presents an overview of prospects and applications while emphasizing modern, cutting-edge, and emerging areas of biotechnology. Further, it provides the readers with a comprehensive knowledge of topics in food and agricultural biotechnology, microbial biotechnology, environmental biotechnology and animal biotechnology. The chapters have been written with special reference to the latest developments in above broader areas of biotechnology that impact the biotechnology industry. A list of references at the end of each chapter is provided for the readers to learn more about a particular topic. Typically, these references include basic research, research papers, review articles and articles from the popular literature","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a015c7d1b338c5ddd42ff44bd134303fe1a6c2a","amp;dn":"Biotechnology+Prospects+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a015c7d1b338c5ddd42ff44bd134303fe1a6c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,1,92,125,27,51,140,93,221,66,255,68,189,19,67,3,254,26,108,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
