Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nTRY, TRY AGAIN\r\n\r\nFriday at 8PM ET on Fox Business\r\n\r\nFailure is good! Here's the Stossel show\r\n\r\nTHE &quot;F&quot; WORD: Lots of people treat &quot;failure&quot; like a bad word, but it's not! Success is &quot;fueled by failure,&quot; says former Olympian and NFL wide receiver Jeremy Bloom. Lots of people failed miserably before they became successful. He says when you fail, it's important to be a &quot;bouncer&quot;, not a &quot;splatter.&quot;\r\n\r\nWINNERS NEVER QUIT: Steve Jobs, JK Rowling, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, and several others only got there because they first failed, but then learned from their failures. Hershey's first two chocolate stores failed. Henry Ford's first company went broke. Walt Disney's first cartoon company declared bankruptcy. But they all tried again.\r\n\r\nADDICTED TO FAILURE: Government fails again and again and doesn't learn from its failures. Politicians don't have to! Unlike entrepreneurs, who put their own money on the line, politicians spend ours!\r\n\r\nFAILING OUR KIDS: Kids don't need so much protection from failure. Let them fail so they can learn how to succeed!\r\n\r\nMEDICAL MISTAKES: Science experiments fail all the time, and we're better off for it! If scientists didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't have Penicillin, X-Ray machines, rubber, nylon, Velcro, Viagra, Rogaine, or NutraSweet.\r\n\r\nMY TAKE: My first business failed. I invented the first\r\n\r\nI succeeded on 20/20, but 20/20's first show was such a failure, the boss fired the hosts the next day. Eventually I failed at 20/20, because I couldn't talk my bosses into doing more stories he called, &quot;predictable libertarian propaganda.&quot; So I left. Failure? Hardly. It's what allowed me to come to Fox and do this show.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13498aa1b36b65b028e55169faf6a5a2475cbef","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.10.16.Try.Try.Again.720p.WEBrip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13498aa1b36b65b028e55169faf6a5a2475cbef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,52,152,170,27,54,182,91,2,142,85,22,159,175,106,90,36,117,203,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
