Recording was finished in July 2015. &quot;Svbversvm&quot; is another step upon the Black Path that is RAM's career and showcases the band's best songwriting and performances ever. Expect a malicious attack of pure heavy metal tyranny!\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01. Return of the Iron Tyrant\r\n02. Eyes of the Night\r\n03. The Usurper\r\n04. Enslaver\r\n05. Holy Death\r\n06.
