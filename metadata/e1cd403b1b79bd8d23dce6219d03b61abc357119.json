Characters and alien wildlife are brought to life through a rigorous simulation and the game plays out as a tug-of-war between humans and nature on a planet full of opportunities and dangers.\r\nUnderstanding the alien environment is crucial - discovered resources and crafting options enable you to adapt when food gets scarce, equipment breaks and alien animals attack.\r\n\r\nYour role / indirect control\r\nIn this game you will not feel like a commander issuing orders, because the settlers have no command chain but rely on voting if they disagree. You will get the sense that you're part of the community, organizing your groupâ€™s decisions, not bossing them around. You do this by using the Pioneer Planning Unit, an instrument issued by the Tau Ceti Mission. You will feel like a member of the group, sharing their victories and failures.\r\n\r\nSetting\r\nThe game takes place in a realistic sci-fi setting, in a plausible future without Faster-than-Light travel.\r\nThe year is 2238 and Earthâ€™s first and only interstellar colonization ship has reached the end goal of its 100 year journey â€“ a terran planet in the Tau Ceti star system. 2100 humans will now make this planet their new home. There are no additional supplies or reinforcements coming in - they must make do with what they brought and what they can find","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1cd403b1b79bd8d23dce6219d03b61abc357119","amp;dn":"Unclaimed+World+v04.0.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1cd403b1b79bd8d23dce6219d03b61abc357119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,205,64,59,27,121,189,141,35,220,230,33,157,3,182,26,188,53,113,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
