Very little film footage was officially released and it sat unreleased until 2015, when the Stones Archive released the full performance on CD/DVD/Blu-ray to coincide with the deluxe reissue of Sticky Fingers. The truncated set -- just eight songs, with alternate takes of &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Bitch&quot; added as bonus tracks -- reflects how it was intended for television but even though this is short, it's mighty. The Stones had recently wrapped their farewell tour of the U.K. -- for tax purposes, they were leaving the country to reside in France -- and Sticky Fingers' release was on the horizon, so they were in fighting form and still sounded hungry when cranking out &quot;Bitch&quot; and &quot;Brown Sugar.&quot; Although they've expanded to add a horn section, they have yet to get bogged down with spectacle: they're still a lean, hard rock &amp; roll band. Often, the attraction here is the grime and grit but they're also grooving hard, as evidenced by the swinging &quot;Let It Rock&quot; and how &quot;Satisfaction&quot; gets funky. It all adds up to one of the band's finest live performances and it's a pleasure to finally have it officially released.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLISTING:\r\n\r\n1. Live With Me\r\n2. Dead Flowers\r\n3.
