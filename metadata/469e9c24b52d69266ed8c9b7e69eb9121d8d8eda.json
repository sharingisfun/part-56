Berg (Springer, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0387008888\r\n\r\nEscherichia coli, commonly referred to as E. coli, has been the organism of choice for molecular genetics for decades. Its machinery and mobile behavior is one of the most fascinating topics for cell scientists. Scientists and engineers, not trained in microbiology, and who would like to learn more about living machines, can see it as a unique example. This cross-disciplinary monograph covers more than thirty years of research and is accessible to graduate students and scientists alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469e9c24b52d69266ed8c9b7e69eb9121d8d8eda","amp;dn":"E.+coli+in+Motion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469e9c24b52d69266ed8c9b7e69eb9121d8d8eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,158,156,36,181,45,105,38,110,216,201,183,230,158,185,18,29,141,142,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
