Fournier (CRC, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781439826713\r\n\r\nEncompassing a variety of engineering disciplines and life sciences, the very scope and breadth of biomedical engineering presents challenges to creating a concise, entry level text that effectively introduces basic concepts without getting overly specialized in subject matter or rarified in language. Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering, Third Edition meets and overcomes these challenges to provide the beginning student with the foundational tools and the confidence they need to apply these techniques to problems of ever greater complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing together fundamental engineering and life science principles, this highly accessible text provides a focused coverage of key momentum and mass transport concepts in biomedical engineering. It offers a basic review of units and dimensions, material balances, and problem-solving tips, and then emphasizes those chemical and physical transport processes that have applications in the development of artificial and bioartificial organs, controlled drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. The book also includes a discussion of thermodynamic concepts and covers topics such as body fluids, osmosis and membrane filtration, physical and flow properties of blood, solute and oxygen transport, and pharmacokinetic analysis. It concludes with the application of these principles to extracorporeal devices as well as tissue engineering and bioartificial organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigned for the beginning student, Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering, Third Edition provides a quantitative understanding of the underlying physical, chemical, and biological phenomena involved. It offers mathematical models using the â€˜shell balance&quot; or compartmental approaches, along with numerous examples and end-of-chapter problems based on these mathematical models and in many cases these models are compared with actual experimental data. Encouraging students to work examples with the mathematical software package of their choice, this text provides them the opportunity to explore various aspects of the solution on their own, or apply these techniques as starting points for the solution to their own problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76ec3b52e00856e3ec18ccac0670633a06e6fb2c","amp;dn":"Basic+Transport+Phenomena+in+Biomedical+Engineering+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76ec3b52e00856e3ec18ccac0670633a06e6fb2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,236,59,82,224,8,86,227,236,24,204,172,6,112,99,58,6,230,251,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
