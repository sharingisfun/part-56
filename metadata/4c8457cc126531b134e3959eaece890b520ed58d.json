Led by the author Amos Oz, a group of kibbutzniks joined together in intimate, taped conversations directly after returning from battlefield.\r\nAt the time only a few of these recordings were permitted to gain a public hearing by the Israeli government, but this film reveals them to the public for the first time. The uncensored testimonies suggest that the soldiers were not euphoric about the outcome, but instead were profoundly depressed about what the victory cost.\r\nIn this brilliantly-conceived documentary, director Mor Loushy takes the old testimonies recorded by the Israeli soldiers in the immediate aftermath of the war, and plays the recordings back to the now-aged veterans and observes their responses.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/The-Six-Day-War-Censored-Voices-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3422Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~124Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2 (mainly Hebrew with some English)\r\n * Run-Time: 80 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.98 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Embedded and merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s0g85","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c8457cc126531b134e3959eaece890b520ed58d","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2015+The+Six-Day+War+Censored+Voices+720p+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c8457cc126531b134e3959eaece890b520ed58d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,132,87,204,18,101,49,177,52,227,149,158,174,206,137,11,82,14,213,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
