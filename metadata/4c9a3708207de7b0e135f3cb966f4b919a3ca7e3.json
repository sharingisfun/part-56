This work resulted in a digitally remastered compilation released in late 2000. Unlike its predecessors, this project, Flashback, was personally approved and endorsed by Lynne. The set includes songs featured from all 11 studio albums up to that point, including an edit of &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; from their live album The Night the Light Went On in Long Beach, plus some new recordings amongst the band's extensive back catalog, most notably a reworking of Lynne's only UK number one hit &quot;Xanadu&quot;. The album includes liner notes by David Wild with quotes on each song from Lynne and a booklet inside.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\nAll tracks written by Jeff Lynne, except where noted.
