Then several award winning directors followed the footsteps and engaged in massive projects to explores our roots and project Sri Lankaâ€™s rich cultural traditions to the world. â€˜Mahindagamanayaâ€™ and â€˜Kusa Pabaâ€™ are the latest films which got tremendous attraction of the Sri Lankan movie lovers. â€˜The God Kingâ€™ and â€˜ Veera Puran Appuâ€™ were two of the old hits in the history of Sri Lankan cinema based on historic epics. They all proved one common fact; films based on historic epics have never failed to enthrall the audience. Packed with action, battle scenes and drama such films have the uncanny touch to leave a â€˜historic impactâ€™ in the industry.\r\n\r\nSugath Samarakoonâ€™s epic â€˜Vijaya Kuweniâ€™ â€“ Rejuvenating of Kuveni the Yakka Princess\r\n \r\nWell known playwright and actor Sugath Samarakoon is the latest artiste to take to the task with his epic film â€˜Vijaya Kuweniâ€™. Samarakoon well-known for his controversy ridden plays like â€˜Uthure Rahula Himiâ€™ and â€˜Commando Diyasenaâ€™ in 1980s has returned to the limelight with this massive cinematic venture, a story of the â€˜Mahawamsa. It is only after doing an in-depth analysis for seven years on the Vijay-Kuveni story that Samarakoon started work on the project to present the injustice done to Kuveni.\r\n \r\nâ€œI donâ€™t think the Mahavamsa tells the real story about our ancestors. Ven Mahanama thera does not tell the real story of Kuveni. For some reason or other, he has buried the true details and tried to highlight the heroics of king Vijaya. Kuweni was branded a traitor because she helped Vijaya capture the island. However it was Vijaya who betrayed her in the end because his friends and advisors requested him to bring an Aryan princess to bear fair skinned children as future heirs to the throne,â€\r\n \r\nFilming was done in Anuradhapura, Rajanganaya, Gampaha and Pilkuththuva. Roger Seniviratne plays the role of King Vijaya while the Dulani Anuradha of Aba fame gives life to Kuveni. Minister Mervin Silva portrays the role of Kuveniâ€™s father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : HEVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : High Efficiency Video Coding\r\nFormat profile                           :   @Main\r\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC\r\nDuration                                 : 2h 6mn\r\nWidth                                    : 716 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 328 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.35:1\r\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 2.35:1\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\r\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\r\nDuration                                 : 2h 6mn\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nDelay relative to video                  : -21ms\r\nTitle                                    : Sinhalese, Dolby Pro Logic II\r\nLanguage                                 : Sinhalese\r\nDefault                                  : Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5167c21e88829563994b1ded6e2d1a4879c9953d","amp;dn":"Vijaya.Kuweni.2012.DVDRip.x265.EngHardcoded.RealBoss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5167c21e88829563994b1ded6e2d1a4879c9953d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,103,194,30,136,130,149,99,153,75,29,237,110,45,26,72,121,201,149,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
