KÃ¤utner uses the framing device of an automobile whose various owners serve as the film's protagonists and initiate its episodic structure. The characters represent an interesting cross-section of the German people including a deserting soldier, a Jewish couple and a composer who has been labeled as subversive.\r\n\r\nThe film was produced in Hamburg in the British Zone as part of a growing post-war trend in Western Germany of moving film production away from its traditional centre of Berlin. The film was made under extremely difficult conditions including a lack of raw film stock and hunger amongst the cast and technicians. The director, Helmut KÃ¤utner, had several of his earlier films banned by the Nazis which led to him being perceived as possessing greater moral authority than many of his colleagues. Consequently, the film was seen as a standard-bearer for the values of the post-war German film industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 696x574, 24.000 fps, 1800 Kbps, 01h42m27s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, mono, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, German audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Arabic, English, French, German, Italian\r\n                   Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ef74oeu8f/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/a0gnp4eqd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/87dr0stjp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5os2047th/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/rmjxg5xg5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:649aed26f84cff4fcf18d965b500e672c6eefdd3","amp;dn":"In+jenen+Tagen+-+Seven+Journeys+%281947+-+Germany%29+%5Bwar%5D+multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"649aed26f84cff4fcf18d965b500e672c6eefdd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,154,237,38,248,76,255,79,207,24,217,101,181,0,230,114,198,238,253,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
