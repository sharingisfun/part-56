Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Robert Kelly\r\n\r\nEpisode 253: Monday starts off with a case of the Mondayâ€™s and Ant talking about doing Greg Gutfeldâ€™s new show, hot chicks on Fox News, his new iPhone, Bitcoin issues, and the â€œMexican hurricane.â€ He discusses Amy and Chuck Schumer being related and their views, curtailing violence, the latest police shooting the news didnâ€™t cover, shitbag Al Sharpton, scuba diving for guns, murder/detective TV shows, and bad dreams. Ant mocks natural disaster movies, we see a plane metering a hurricane, Ant shits on new movies, talks about Seth Rogan, #AutisticDeNiro, Piers Morgan, Adam Sandler, Apple TV, and being lazy as fuck. After a caller fanboys out, we see a video of a possible Russian invention, hear Anthonyâ€™s life routine with air disaster movies, he gives his thoughts on a question asked by The New York Times, we hear from a few callers, Anthony exposes his favorite Twitter follow, and we get a little #Scorchtober. Bobby Kelly calls in to talk about his show tonight, sex and finger blasting in comedy clubs, his upcoming trip to Canada, places heâ€™d like to go, reverse lives, being a family guy, getting caught cheating, forgetting the passion, and secret sex. TACS wraps going through the mail, talking about Days of Our Lives, Ricky Gervais, having teeth confidence, and a man who killed his zombie pal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f9d15729076f8a49954e28c5b6539cd1c067bc","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-26+Robert+Kelly+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f9d15729076f8a49954e28c5b6539cd1c067bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,249,209,87,41,7,111,138,73,149,78,40,197,182,83,156,209,192,103,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
