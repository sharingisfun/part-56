Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The original source material was very dark; I bumped up the brightness in spots (although they were constantly tweaking the video during the broadcast as well, it's all over the place) and made some color adjustments in an attempt to make this watchable. MP3 is included although I'm not sure how enjoyable it is without the video. Both the video resolution and audio bitrate were bumped up just for this special. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nGuest: Jim Florentine\r\n\r\nEpisode 252: Another week comes to a close with a made-up Anthony who is joined by Jim Florentine somewhat ragging on his looks, Ant talks about being on panel shows, Jim bitches about his gigs cock blocking his life, and they chat about the Mets, their fans, the players, and their predictions. Bobo calls to explain his evening after the Mets won, Jim hits Bobo with a â€œwould ya?,â€ and Bobo expresses his excitement about his game 3 Mets tickets. Ant and Florentine then talk about living the easy life, getting blown off in the industry, acting gigs, getting cut from acting gigs, going out to the movies, they basically spoil â€œTrainwreck,â€ defend Amy Schumer, and talk about child pornography and teenage nudie pics (unrelated). Jim tells us about his friend Chuck, they discuss phone protection, the â€œlandscapeâ€ of dating, Tinder, fantasy sports, football, getting duped by news satire, movies, documentaries, cocaine, and getting chicks back in the day in Long Island. They laugh about old hotel stories, team rivalries, fighting, picking up chicks in local bars, gay clubs, New Yearâ€™s in Time Square, drinking in public, getting out of drinking in public, the doâ€™s and donâ€™ts of DUIâ€™s, and we hear what Gavin McInnes said about Anthony on Rogan. They wrap up the day talking about radio bullshit and gossip, divorce, #DiceAdvice, dealing with exes, and Jim tells us a riveting story about â€œmarking one on his chest.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74299264216b5f97c1011ab143801ebc597f3db3","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-22+Jim+Florentine+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74299264216b5f97c1011ab143801ebc597f3db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,41,146,100,33,107,95,151,193,1,26,177,67,128,30,188,89,127,61,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
