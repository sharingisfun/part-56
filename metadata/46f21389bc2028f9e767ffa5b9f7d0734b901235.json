All for the purpose to solve numerically equations whose associated functions can be also non-differentiable in the ordinary sense. That is among others extending the classical Newton method theory which requires usual differentiability of function.\r\n\r\nChapters are self-contained and can be read independently and several advanced courses can be taught out of this book. An extensive list of references is given per chapter. The bookâ€™s results are expected to find applications in many areas of applied mathematics, stochastics, computer science and engineering. As such this monograph is suitable for researchers, graduate students, and seminars of the above subjects, also to be in all science and engineering libraries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f21389bc2028f9e767ffa5b9f7d0734b901235","amp;dn":"Intelligent+Numerical+Methods+-+George+A.+Anastassiou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f21389bc2028f9e767ffa5b9f7d0734b901235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,242,19,137,188,32,40,249,231,103,255,165,185,247,208,115,75,144,18,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
