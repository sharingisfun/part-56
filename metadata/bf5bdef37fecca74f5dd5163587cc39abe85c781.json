Now it's time for a vacation. But their hopes for a perfect Paris holiday are dashed when Cat awakes one night in terror. She's having visions of a vampire named Gregor, who's more powerful than Bones and has ties to her past that even Cat herself didn't know about.\r\n\r\nGregor believes Cat is his and won't stop until he has her. As the battle begins between the vamp who haunts her nightmares and the one who holds her heart, only Cat can break Gregor's hold over her. She'll need all the power she can summon in order to bring down the baddest bloodsucker she's ever faced ... even if getting that power will result in an early grave","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5bdef37fecca74f5dd5163587cc39abe85c781","amp;dn":"Jeaniene+Frost-Destined+for+an+Early+Grave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5bdef37fecca74f5dd5163587cc39abe85c781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,91,222,243,127,236,202,116,245,221,81,99,88,124,195,154,190,133,199,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
