She and the male tribute, Peeta Mellark, are escorted to the Capitol\r\nby chaperone Effie Trinket and their mentor Haymitch Abernathy, a past District 12\r\nvictor and alcoholic. Haymitch impresses on them the importance of gaining sponsors,\r\nas they can provide gifts of food and supplies during the Games. During part of a\r\nseries of televised interviews, Peeta publicly expresses his love for Katniss, which\r\nshe initially takes as an attempt to earn sponsor favor, but later learns his love is\r\ngenuine. While training, Katniss observes the Careers, Marvel, Glimmer, Cato, and\r\nClove, tributes from Districts 1 and 2 who have been training for the Games from a\r\nyoung age.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs supplies from\r\nthe ground around the Cornucopia, the structure where the contestants start, and\r\nnarrowly avoids being killed; about a quarter of the tributes are killed in the initial\r\nmelee, and only eleven survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay as far away from\r\nthe other competitors as possible, but Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane triggers a forest\r\nfire to drive her back towards the others. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta\r\nhas seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the others to wait her out.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $78,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $152,535,747 (USA) (23 March 2012)\r\nGross: $407,999,255 (USA) (31 August 2012)\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/89953548446977152900.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/98862539879850878669.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/13027901515388485538.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/04037934215885159005.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/50039051535991188273.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/29551304143380460569.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 11.5 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:22:29\r\nSample: No\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS\r\nAudio Bit rate: 1509 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 6 channels 5.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3656478392f52b73425ded073a11b6e20f2327cc","amp;dn":"Hunger+Games+-+%5B2012%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3656478392f52b73425ded073a11b6e20f2327cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,86,71,131,146,245,43,115,66,93,237,7,58,17,182,226,15,35,39,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
