While out with her father herding sheep, he falls and is killed. Ethan, a bearded stranger appears, carrying his body, and plants himself on the farm. Toss fears heâ€™s Lucifer and is confused when he and her mother become lovers. It is through Ethan, however, that Toss comes to terms with her fatherâ€™s death and the first stirrings of womanhood. Vincent Wardâ€™s debut feature was the first NZ film selected for competition at Cannes; LA Timesâ€™ critic Kevin Thomas lauded it as â€œa work of awesome beautyâ€.\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.nzonscreen.com/title/vigil-1984\r\n\r\n\r\n.mkv\r\n\r\nripped from DVD\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly seed this rare film","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93d79051ad950483079db08078e3ec8ed0e4701d","amp;dn":"Vigil+1984+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93d79051ad950483079db08078e3ec8ed0e4701d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,215,144,81,173,149,4,131,7,157,176,128,120,227,236,142,208,228,112,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
