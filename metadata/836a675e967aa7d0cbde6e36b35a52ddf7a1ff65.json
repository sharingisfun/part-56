Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nKennedy kicks the night off talking about the View &amp; their comments about Fiorina. Apparently they're more concerned with the way Fiorina looks than her policy. Carely is supposed to go back on the show this Friday, so we'll see how that goes.\r\n\r\nTonight's party panel consists of JULIE ROSINSKY, JIMMY FAILLA, and MATT WELCH. They continue to talk about The View &amp; Fiorina. (Also touching on if The View would ever say similar things about Clinton.) Paul Ryan is now the speaker of the House. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are running for president. Is the GOP trending younger for the first time ever? At a Meet the Press interview Jeb Bush acknowledged that his debate performance could have been better and that his campaign is sagging. Of course he cloaked the whole statement in smug arrogance.\r\n\r\nLast week the White House announced that a small number of special operations forces were going to be deployed in Syria as part of the United State's anti-ISIS strategy. The special ops are supposed to be training moderates, not leading charges. But is it a good idea either way? DR. RON PAUL the consummate anti-war advocate is against it and here to detail why. He says there's no plan, no exit strategy, no entry strategy, and is escalating the situation. Afterwards they move on to the nomination of Speaker Ryan. Ron Paul thinks it'll be more of the same. \r\n\r\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan recently gave an interview talking about the smell of his new office. Apparently Speaker Boehner had a nasty smoking habit. Tattoo popularity has sky rocketed. Unsurprisingly so has regret about getting said tattoos. Tiger Wood's long time caddy has released a memoir that details his time spent with Woods. Apparently he's a difficult boss. Quote, &quot;It's like I was a slave.&quot; \r\n\r\nBRIAN BRENBERG of King's College is here to talk about 'the Debt Bomb.' Washington has recently passed a new budget. We're well on track to owing 19.5 trillion by the time Obama leaves office. Bush doubled the debt - now Obama has done it again. It's really a bipartisan issue.\r\n\r\nNightcap. Kennedy suits up to step onto the frontlines of the war against Christmas. It's November 2nd, and she's already hearing Christmas music. This makes Kennedy mad.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.11.02.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 250 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 39s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 39s\r\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.106\r\nStream size                              : 209 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 39s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 38.1 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:836a675e967aa7d0cbde6e36b35a52ddf7a1ff65","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.11.02.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"836a675e967aa7d0cbde6e36b35a52ddf7a1ff65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,106,103,94,150,122,167,208,203,222,110,54,179,90,82,221,247,161,255,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
