As a result, quantum information has made the transition from an exotic research topic to part of mainstream undergraduate courses in physics. Based on years of teaching experience, this textbook builds from simple fundamental concepts to cover the essentials of the field. Aimed at physics undergraduate students with a basic background in quantum mechanics, it guides readers through theory and experiment, introducing all the central concepts without getting caught up in details. Worked examples and exercises make this useful as a self-study text for those who want a brief introduction before starting on more advanced books","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d93221d73fcdb7818ec21a16b04794c6ed3d6933","amp;dn":"Quantum+Information%2C+Computation+%26amp%3B+Communication","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d93221d73fcdb7818ec21a16b04794c6ed3d6933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,50,33,215,63,205,183,129,142,194,26,22,176,71,148,198,237,61,105,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
