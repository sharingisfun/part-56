But heâ€™s been dogged every step of the way by what he knew, and what he did, about the sexual abuse of children at the hands of paedophile priests. If it wasnâ€™t for Richard Carletonâ€™s interview with the Cardinal on 60 Minutes in 2002, he might just have been believable. But he has since appeared to be a liar, and someone willing to go to great lengths to protect his own reputation. This week 60 Minutes presents damning new evidence against Pell. He has always argued his intervention on behalf of child abuse victims was innovative, independent and compassionate. But now, secret documents reveal it as a cynical smokescreen designed to protect the Catholic Church at all costs.\r\n\r\nTroye Sivan\r\n\r\nTheyâ€™re called Generation Like, sharing every detail of their lives from the most mundane to the most intimate â€“ and the smart ones are making a fortune. Eight years ago Troye Sivan started uploading videos of himself, doing anything and everything, to YouTube. Now this 20-year-old entrepreneur from Perth earns $500,000 a year doing it, and his millions of followers canâ€™t get enough. Time Magazine named him the worldâ€™s second most influential young person after Malala Yousafzei, the Nobel Peace Prize winner. But YouTube also gave Troye Sivan the chance to promote his real passion, singing and songwriting. And now itâ€™s time to go mainstream.\r\n\r\nWorldâ€™s Oldest Baby\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful story about love and hope thatâ€™s been 23 years in the making. When Alex Powell turned 15 his doctor told him he had cancer and needed to start chemotherapy straight away. It was the early 1990s, and neither doctor nor teenager thought about preserving Alexâ€™s fertility. Luckily his stepmother did. So the embarrassed teenager agreed to make some awkward visits to the sperm bank â€“ and 23 three years later it has proven to be the best decision of his life. Alex has just set a world record by becoming a father to little Xavier â€“ the worldâ€™s oldest baby.\r\n\r\nExtra Minutes: Troye Sivan on marriage equality\r\n\r\nTroye Sivan opens up about marriage equality, saying Australiaâ€™s current legal stance is &quot;embarrassing.&quot;\r\n\r\nExtra Minutes Dr Anazodo | Sydney Children's Hospital\r\n\r\nDr Antoinette Anazodo explains how one &quot;embarrassing conversation&quot; can change somebody's life.\r\n\r\nExtra Minutes: â€œThis isnâ€™t a battle, this is a war.â€\r\n\r\nCommissioner Peter Saunders commends the Fostersâ€™ 19 year long â€œcourageousâ€ fight for justice.\r\n\r\nExtra Minutes: Weâ€™re all Waiting\r\n\r\nWatch Catherine Britt's stunning film clip for her original song, Weâ€™re all Waiting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d2739b3b54c39a34905dea42b35b2e004e7c38","amp;dn":"60.Minutes.Australia.2015.12.06.360p.LDTV.9jumpin.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d2739b3b54c39a34905dea42b35b2e004e7c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,210,115,155,59,84,195,154,52,144,93,234,66,179,91,46,0,78,124,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
