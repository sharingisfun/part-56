The taglines used in advertising the film included &quot;A fast drive to Paradise turns into a nuclear nightmare!&quot; and &quot;Mad Max meets The China Syndrome&quot;.\r\n\r\nAt the WALDO nuclear facility, Dr Heinrich Schmidt goes to deal with an emergency, only to receive a fatal dose of radiation exposure from a flooded containment breach. He is placed under medical quarantine but makes an escape. Mechanic Larry Stillson and his wife Carmel go off to spend a weekend together at a small Australian Outback town. Their idyll is then interrupted by the arrival of the amnesiac Heinrich. At the same time, sinister mercenaries employed by WALDO arrive in the area to stop Heinrich before he lets it known to the public that irradiated material from the plant has leaked into the local water table.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 686x574, 25.000 fps, 1985 Kbps, 01h28m25s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 448 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bjh78hkyn/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/57tdzes23/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ftd9beydn/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9uzg16fez/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/b6779nb0r/\r\n\r\ncredit ripper t------r and source RL, September 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b5d44d352a0b0a88324e89b107a098ad645bed","amp;dn":"The+Chain+Reaction+%5BNuclear+Run%5D+%281980+-+Australia%29+action+scifi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b5d44d352a0b0a88324e89b107a098ad645bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,181,212,77,53,42,11,10,136,50,78,137,177,7,160,152,173,100,91,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
