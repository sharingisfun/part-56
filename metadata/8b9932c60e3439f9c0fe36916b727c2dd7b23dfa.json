In tense, searing prose, punctuated with the blackest of humor, Cooney documents the slow erosion of her mother's mind, the powerful bond the two shared, and her own descent into drink and despair.\r\n\r\nBut the coping mechanism that finally serves this eloquent writer best is writing, the ability to bring to vivid life the memories her mother is losing. As her mother gropes in the gathering darkness for a grip on the world she once loved, succeeding only in conjuring sad fantasies of places and times with her late husband, Cooney revisits their true past. Death in Slow Motion becomes the mesmerizing story of Eleanor's actual childhood, straight out of the pages of John Cheever; the daring and vibrant mother she remembers; and a time that no longer exists for either of them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b9932c60e3439f9c0fe36916b727c2dd7b23dfa","amp;dn":"Death+in+Slow+Motion+-+Eleanor+Cooney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b9932c60e3439f9c0fe36916b727c2dd7b23dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,153,50,198,14,52,57,249,192,254,54,145,107,114,124,45,215,178,61,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
