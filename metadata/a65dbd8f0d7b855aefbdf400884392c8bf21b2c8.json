The band, featuring George Benson on guitar, is relaxed and funky without being in your face about it, and unlike much soul-jazz of the time, most of the material is original, Smith having penned six of the eight numbers. Although the riffs often owe a lot to James Brown, this is definitely at least as much jazz as soul, with Lonnie taking a rare vocal turn on &quot;Peace of Mind.&quot;\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - I Can't Stand It\r\n02 - Expressions\r\n03 - Scream\r\n04 - Play It Back\r\n05 - Love Bowl\r\n06 - Peace Of Mind\r\n07 - I Want To Thank You\r\n08 - Seven Steps To Heaven\r\n\r\n*1995 Blue Note / Capitol | CDP 7243 8 31880 2 4 {Blue Note Rare Groove Series}\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nLonnie Smith (organ)\r\nDave Hubbard (tenor sax)\r\nRonnie Cuber (bari sax)\r\nGeorge Benson (guitar)\r\nJoe Dukes (drums)\r\nGary Jones (conga)\r\nClifford Mack (tambourine)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLonnie Smith - Move Your Hand (1969) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9051597/Lonnie_Smith_-_Move_Your_Hand_%281969%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\nLonnie Smith = John Abercrombie Trio - Afro Blue (1994) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9061329/Lonnie_Smith___John_Abercrombie_Trio_-_Afro_Blue_%281994%29_%5BEAC-FLA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a65dbd8f0d7b855aefbdf400884392c8bf21b2c8","amp;dn":"Lonnie+Smith+-+Live+At+Club+Mozambique+%281970%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a65dbd8f0d7b855aefbdf400884392c8bf21b2c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,93,189,143,13,123,133,90,239,189,244,0,136,67,146,200,191,33,178,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
