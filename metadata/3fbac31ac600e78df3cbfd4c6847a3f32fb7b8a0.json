Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fbac31ac600e78df3cbfd4c6847a3f32fb7b8a0","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+311-320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fbac31ac600e78df3cbfd4c6847a3f32fb7b8a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,186,195,26,198,0,231,141,243,203,253,76,104,71,163,243,47,183,184,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
