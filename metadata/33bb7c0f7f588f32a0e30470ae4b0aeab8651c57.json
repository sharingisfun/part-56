They have been a key influence on subsequent generations of women musicians, from Courtney Love, Bjork and the &quot;Riot Grrrl&quot; bands to today's diary-like singers such as Lily Allen and Kate Nash. The Slits were one of the first punk bands, and their debut album's release in 1979 was regarded as a five-star triumph. The pioneering mix of the band's punk roots and legendary reggae producer Dennis Bovell created an extraordinary masterpiece. \r\nThirty years on, 'Cut' is still lionised as a landmark post-punk album. This digitally-remastered reissue of the classic 1979 album contains 30 bonus tracks, including recently discovered demos, dub versions and outtakes that shed new light on the making of the album. It also features two trailblazing BBC sessions for John Peel that capture The Slits at their ferocious best.\r\n\r\nTrack listing:\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n\r\n1. &quot;Instant Hit&quot; - 2:43\r\n2. &quot;So Tough&quot; - 2:40\r\n3. &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; - 3:16\r\n4. &quot;Shoplifting&quot; - 1:36\r\n5. &quot;Fm&quot; - 3:34\r\n6. &quot;Newtown&quot; - 3:48\r\n7. &quot;Ping Pong Affair&quot; - 4:15\r\n8. &quot;Love Und Romance&quot; - 2:27\r\n9. &quot;Typical Girls&quot; - 3:55\r\n10. &quot;Adventures Close To Home&quot; - 3:24\r\n11. &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; - 3:59\r\n12. &quot;Liebe And Romanze&quot; (slow version) - 4:44\r\n13. &quot;Typical Girls&quot; (Brink Style Dub) - 4:18\r\n14. &quot;Love And Romance&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1977) - 2:24\r\n15. &quot;Vindictive&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1977) - 2:14\r\n16. &quot;Newtown&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1977) - 3:28\r\n17. &quot;Shoplifting&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1977) - 1:28\r\n18. &quot;So Tough&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1978) - 2:16\r\n19. &quot;Instant Hit&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1978) - 2:30\r\n20. &quot;FM&quot; (John Peel BBC Radio 1 Session 1978) - 3:34  \r\n\r\nTotal Play Time: 62:33\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n\r\n1. &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; (Rough Mix) - 3:45\r\n2. &quot;Instant Hit&quot; (8 Track Demo) - 2:32\r\n3. &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; (8 Track Demo) - 3:27\r\n4. &quot;Newtown&quot; (8 Track Demo) - 3:37\r\n5. &quot;Adventures Close To Home&quot; (8 Track Demo) - 3:37\r\n6. &quot;Instant Hit&quot; (Rough Mix) - 2:42\r\n7. &quot;So Tough&quot; (Rough Mix) - 2:39\r\n8. &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; (Toast Version) - 3:18\r\n9. &quot;Shoplifting&quot; (Rough Mix) - 1:38\r\n10. &quot;FM&quot; (Rough Mix) - 3:52\r\n11. &quot;Newtown&quot; (Rough Mix) - 4:30\r\n12. &quot;Ping Pong Affair&quot; (Rough Mix) - 4:39\r\n13. &quot;Love Und Romance&quot; (Rough Mix) - 2:27\r\n14. &quot;Typical Girls&quot; (Rough Mix) - 4:16\r\n15. &quot;Adventures Close To Home&quot; (Rough Mix) - 3:26\r\n16. &quot;So Tough&quot; (Outtake) - 1:37\r\n17. &quot;Instant Hit&quot; (Instrumental Outtake) - 2:33\r\n18. &quot;Typical Girls&quot; (Instrumental Outtake) - 4:00\r\n19. &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; (Dub Version) - 3:15\r\n20. &quot;In The Beginning, There Was Rhythm&quot; - 5:53\r\n\r\nTotal Play Time: 69:43 \r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\n\r\nAri Up  - vocals\r\nViv Albertine - guitar\r\nTessa Pollitt - bass guitar\r\nBudgie - drums\r\nDennis Bovell - sound effects\r\n\r\nCD Release date: 13/10/2009\r\n\r\n\r\nRipped by Darkside","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33bb7c0f7f588f32a0e30470ae4b0aeab8651c57","amp;dn":"The+Slits+-+Cut+%282CD+Deluxe+Edition%29+%281979-2009%29+EAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33bb7c0f7f588f32a0e30470ae4b0aeab8651c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,187,124,15,127,88,143,50,160,227,4,112,174,75,10,234,184,101,28,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
