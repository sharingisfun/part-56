That's the only difference in the scripts. Thought about calling it the Weeaboo translation for the concept of using Japanese when a perfectly good English equivalent exists, but decided a true to form Weeaboo would likewise use the Japanese term Otaku instead of the English Weeaboo too. \r\n\r\nYour translator strongly prefers Otaku style translations on everything, though the references to gods and God probably works better in English when Shinigami's also translated out as god of death. But those familiar with the term Shinigami probably make those connections without needing them spelled out so blatantly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca39cf2270406ea63b5c72e6023081c9cda4f4f6","amp;dn":"Death+Note%3A+The+Musical","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca39cf2270406ea63b5c72e6023081c9cda4f4f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,57,207,34,112,64,110,166,59,92,114,230,2,48,129,201,205,164,244,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
