Schalkhammer (Springer, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9783764365899\r\n\r\nModern analytical biotechnology is focused on the use of a set of enabling platform technologies that provide contemporary, state-of-the-art tools for genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, drug discovery, screening, and analysis of natural product molecules. Thus, analytical biotechnology covers all areas of bioanalysis from biochips and nano-chemistry to biology and high throughput screening. Moreover, it aims to apply advanced automation and micro fabricaÂ­ tion technology to the development of robotic and fluidic devices as well as integrated systems. This book focuses on enhancement technology development by promoting cross-disciplinary approaches directed toward solving key problems in biology and medicine. The scope thus brings under one umbrella many different techniques in allied areas. The purpose is to support and teach the fundamental principles and practical uses of major instrumental techniques. Major platforms are the use of immobilized molecules in biotechnology and bioanalysis, imÂ­ munological techniques, immunological strip tests, fluorescence detection and confocal techniques, optical and electrochemical biosensors, biochips, micro dotting, novel transducers such as nano clusters, atomic force microscopy based techniques and analysis in complex media such as fermentation broth, plasma and serum. Techniques related to HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry have not been included in this book but will be covered by further publications. Fundamentals in analytical biotechnology include basic and practical aspects of characterizing and analyzing DNA, proteins, and small metabolites","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:641b41691c0e62346b4c34cd29cce7c0e042850b","amp;dn":"Analytical+Biotechnology+-+Thomas+G.M.+Schalkhammer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"641b41691c0e62346b4c34cd29cce7c0e042850b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,27,65,105,28,14,98,52,107,76,52,205,41,204,231,192,224,66,133,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
