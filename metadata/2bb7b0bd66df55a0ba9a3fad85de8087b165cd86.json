Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™ve used music software before, youâ€™re already familiar with one half of Ableton Live. Liveâ€™s Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically.\r\n\r\nBut Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a unique sketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops - everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with Liveâ€™s flexible track routing and more - all without interrupting your creative flow.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n9.5 Release Notes\r\n\r\nImprovements and feature changes:\r\n\r\nâ€”Improved Waveforms: these now look smooth during zoom operations as well as during recording.\r\n- Improved meters: the track volume meters now show both peak and RMS levels.\r\n- Improved colouring: tracks are now automatically coloured, and new Clips take their trackâ€™s color.\r\n- The â€˜Auto assign Clip Colorâ€™ preference is replaced by â€˜Auto assign Track Colorâ€™, which determines if a newly created track gets a color from the song's color sequence assigned or a fixed color chosen by the user.\r\n- Simpler has been completely overhauled with a new interface, Warping, slicing, and new analog modelled filters build in conjunction with Cytomic.\r\n- New analog-modeled filters based on classic vintage hardware models capable of self resonating, feedback and distortion are added to Simpler/Sampler, Auto Filter and Operator.\r\n- The Core Library has been updated with new Drum Kits and new presets for Simpler, Operator, Analog, Auto Filter and Audio Effect Racks.\r\n- Audio Effect Racks now load with devices hidden.\r\n- Sets created with 9.5 will not be openable in pre-9.5 versions of Live. When trying to Save a set created with a previous version in 9.5, a dialog will appear and it will only be possible to Save under a different name.\r\n- Added the option &quot;Preserve Warped Timing&quot; in the Slice to new MIDI track dialog.\r\n- A breakout view is added for Simpler. The breakout view can only be displayed when Simpler has a valid sample\r\n- The Warped waveform is displayed accordingly in Simpler.\r\n- Added a button in the Simpler breakout which warps the region between the sample's start and end markers as a certain number of bars.\r\n- Added 1/2 and x2 warped length buttons in Simpler.\r\n- Added One Shot mode in Simpler.\r\n- Slicing mode has been added to Simpler. When active, all transients between start and end flags will be used for generating the slices\r\n- It is now possible to normalize a sample via a context menu option by right clicking on Simpler's waveform.\r\n- Added the possibility to slicing to a Drum Rack from Simpler.\r\n- A sample volume control (Gain) is now added to Simpler.\r\n- When loading a Simpler, Auto Filter or Operator preset created with a previous Live version, the devices will work in legacy mode, in order to preserve the original sound. An â€œUpgrade buttonâ€ will activate the new filters. The filters will be automatically upgraded if these were not active in the preset.\r\n- Drum pads inherit Warp on/off when slicing a Simpler to Drum Rack.\r\n- If Simpler in Slicing mode is set to one voice only of if its playback mode is set to â€œmonoâ€, choke is activated once converted to a Drum Rack.\r\n- Added Trigger or Gate mode for Samples in One Shot/Slice Modes\r\n- It is now possible to reverse a sample in Simpler via a context menu option.\r\n- Creating a multi selection for a number of chains in a Drum Rack enables setting the choke group for all chains at once.\r\n- When instantiating a plug-in, up to 64 parameters get configured automatically now.\r\n- A parameter configuration can now be saved as a default per AU or VST plug-in. This is done via a new context menu entry available in Live's plug-in device. The default configurations are stored in a &quot;Plug-In Configurations&quot; folder under &quot;User Library/Defaults&quot;.\r\n- Improved performance when drawing waveforms for large sets with many clips.\r\n- Introduced a limitation to how many time a sample can  be sped up or slowed down via &quot;:2&quot; or &quot;x2&quot; respectively, in order to save CPU power.\r\n- Improved the automation smoothing for the new filters in Simpler, Operator and Auto Filter.\r\n- Removed the limitation to the amount of transposition affecting samples when using Complex or Complex Pro.\r\n- The error dialog Live throws when users try to save a Default Device / Track while no User Library is available has been improved.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n\r\n- It is not possible to inadvertently save a Live Set to the Trash anymore.\r\n- The 'Warp as x bars' feature is improved so to provide more musical and predictable values.\r\n- Light blue color tones have changed to avoid being confused with the selection color when using the default Live skin.\r\n- Artifacts might be introduced when transposing samples warped with Complex / Pro.\r\n- Specific plug-ins would have triggered Live to configure non-functional parameters after a preset change.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges for Push:\r\n\r\n- Introduced support for Push 2.\r\n- It is now possible to preview sounds from the browser with Push 1 as well. Auto preview can be toggled on/off.\r\n- It is now possible to load Samples from Push. These will be instantiated in Simpler.\r\n- Browsing of VST and AU plugins is now available for Push 1 as well.\r\n- It is now possible to duplicate Drum Rack pads from Push 1 as well.\r\n- Clip length can be adjusted with a resolution down to 1/16th holding the Shift button.\r\n- Scales settings are now stored in Live sets.\r\n- When recording with Fixed Length: Off, pressing fixed length will now stop recording and loop the last bars of the recording according to the fixed length setting.\r\n- Fixed a bug which would cause the Clip selector in the step sequencer to be displayed after deleting a Clip.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo not make money with this software...\r\n\r\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\nbtscene.cc\r\ncastradio.net\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXV (11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb7b0bd66df55a0ba9a3fad85de8087b165cd86","amp;dn":"Ableton+Live+9+Suite+v9.5+64bit+%2B+M4L+Essentials+v2.0+%2B+M4L+v7.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb7b0bd66df55a0ba9a3fad85de8087b165cd86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,183,176,189,102,223,85,160,186,154,63,173,133,222,128,135,177,101,205,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
