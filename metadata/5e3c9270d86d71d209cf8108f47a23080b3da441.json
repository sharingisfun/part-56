Sicily is somewhere Gino has never been before, but has never visited, so this is a real journey of discovery for him. Home of the mafia, a vibrant street food culture and interesting history, this portside city stops Ginoâ€™s in his tracks. He has an unexpected encounter at the street food market, meets the man who stood up to the mafia, and ends up wine tasting in Marsala, finishing up his day in the vineyard cooking a beautiful chicken in marsala sauce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3c9270d86d71d209cf8108f47a23080b3da441","amp;dn":"Ginos.Italian.Escape.s03e04.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3c9270d86d71d209cf8108f47a23080b3da441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,60,146,112,216,109,113,210,9,207,129,8,244,122,35,8,11,61,164,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
