Together, Suzy and Frank get under the skin of some of its greatest stars - some of whom, like Marie Lloyd and Champagne Charlie, are household names to this day, while the eccentric Victorian comic Dan Leno, later copied by Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel, have fallen into obscurity.\r\n\r\nNot only do Frank and Suzy dig into the history of these stars and the world from which they emerged, but they also study their acts and try their hand at performing them at the end of the show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f9b5bc73db62e8432cd5207e99bc6b606e58023","amp;dn":"What.A.Performance.Pioneers.of.Popular.Entertainment.s01e01.x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f9b5bc73db62e8432cd5207e99bc6b606e58023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,155,91,199,61,182,46,132,50,205,82,7,233,155,198,182,6,229,128,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
