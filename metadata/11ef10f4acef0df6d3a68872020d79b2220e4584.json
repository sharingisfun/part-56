Ant takes a few calls, talks about the speculation surrounding Howard Stern, the movie Roots, Melissa Harris-Perry on MSNBC, shitbag Al Sharpton, the callers weigh in again, and Bonnie McFarlane joins the show. They chat about the new studio, getting made up for TV, doing panel shows, going through â€œphases,â€ using correct verbiage, their love/hate relationship with social media, and Bonnie tells us about growing up in Canada. Bonnie then talks about being exposed to comedy, dating, backwoods parties, her motorcycle, her first TV gig, having confidence, and fucking her professor. Ant recaps his â€œfirst time,â€ his dollyâ€™s, and his pissy eyes, Bonnie talks about having a generic face, they discuss people actually knowing about comedy, jobs before being in the entertainment industry, feminists, LA vs. NY, sex selling, and Bonnie shares an awesome road gig story.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11ef10f4acef0df6d3a68872020d79b2220e4584","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-27+Bonnie+McFarlane+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11ef10f4acef0df6d3a68872020d79b2220e4584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,239,16,244,172,239,13,246,211,166,136,114,2,13,121,178,34,14,69,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
