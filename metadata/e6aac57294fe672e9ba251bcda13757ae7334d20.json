As the world of television blossomed in the 1950â€™s, Roddenberry began to write scripts for police dramas in his spare time. Until one day he came up with a ground-breaking new idea â€“ Star Trek. \r\n\r\nThe original motion picture is set in the twenty-third century when a powerful alien machine called Vger approaches Earth destroying everything in its path. The last possible chance to save the planet is Admiral James T Kirk at the helm of the USS Enterprise. Using impressive special effects it was what legions of Trekkies/Treckers were waiting for.\r\n\r\nThe True Story, through key interviews with Herb Solow, the producer of the Star Trek TV series, Roddenberryâ€™s son, Rod, and Mr Spock himself - Leonard Nimoy charts Roddenberryâ€™s meteoric rise to fame and the lengths he would go to keep his series on air.\r\n\r\nStar Trek didnâ€™t only delight Trekkies, but also went on to inspire the scientific world and NASA scientists to recreate as in reality what they had seen in on screen in Star Trek. \r\n\r\nInvestigating Star Trekâ€™s use of antimatter we reveal how one of the worldâ€™s most expensive physics experiment at CERN Switzerland is trapping the most explosive substance on the planet.\r\n\r\nIn further scientific examples of Roddenberryâ€™s vision, scientists have gone on to develop the first scientific principles of teleportation, the replication of human organs by 3D printers and the creation of artificial intelligence androids.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/12/11/be77e6b633d73014971991e1e8fc47ab.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6aac57294fe672e9ba251bcda13757ae7334d20","amp;dn":"The.True.Story.s05e01.Star.Trek.360p.LDTV.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6aac57294fe672e9ba251bcda13757ae7334d20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,170,197,114,148,254,103,46,155,162,81,188,218,19,117,122,231,51,77,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
