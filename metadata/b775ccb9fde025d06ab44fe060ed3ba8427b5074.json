Kolderie and was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios and Courtyard Studio, Oxfordshire from September to November 1992.\r\nIt features the charting singles: &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, &quot;, and perhaps the band's most well-known hit on mainstream radio, &quot;Creep&quot;.\r\nCreep Honey peaked at No. 22 in the United Kingdom charts and went platinum there and in other countries.\r\nThe album title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says to his victim: &quot;Creep honey? Please come to Florida!&quot; This snippet is sampled by the band on the track &quot;How Do You?&quot;.\r\n\r\nFormat flac  Ripped from Cd by me\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Creep Honey, Radiohead would digress from its alternative rock influences toward more expansive and experimental works.\r\nThe album received a generally favourable critical reaction, but was criticised for its derivative sound and inclusion of underdeveloped songs, and has been in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent albums. However, it has been cited by listeners and critics as one of the best debut albums of recent years.\r\n\r\n        \r\n       Tracklist      \r\n                01 You\r\n  \t\t02 Creep\r\n  \t\t03 Creep (clean)\r\n  \t\t04 Anybody Can Play Guitar\r\n  \t\tcreep,.jpg \t226.99 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b775ccb9fde025d06ab44fe060ed3ba8427b5074","amp;dn":"++Radiohead+-+Creep+Honey+flac+2014+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b775ccb9fde025d06ab44fe060ed3ba8427b5074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,117,204,185,253,224,37,208,106,180,79,224,96,237,59,168,66,123,80,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
