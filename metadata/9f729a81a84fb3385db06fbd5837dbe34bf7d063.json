It documents The Trilogy Concerts, in which the three albums, Pornography (1982), Disintegration (1989) and Bloodflowers (2000) were played live in their entirety one after the other each night, the songs being played in the order in which they appeared on the albums. Trilogy was recorded on two consecutive nights, 11â€“12 November 2002, at the Tempodrom arena in Berlin. A third, previous Trilogy concert in Brussels on 7 November was not used. Robert Smith is quoted on the sleeve about the &quot;trilogy&quot; concept and its eventual execution:\r\n\r\n&quot;The albums Pornography, Disintegration and Bloodflowers are inextricably linked in so many ways, and the realisation of this Trilogy show is one of the highlights of my time in The Cure.&quot;\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nDVD1\r\nPornography Set\r\n\r\n1 Introduction\r\n2 One Hundred Years\r\n3 A Short Term Effect\r\n4 The Hanging Garden\r\n5 Siamese Twins\r\n6 The Figurehead\r\n7 A Strange Day\r\n8 Cold\r\n9 Pornography\r\n\r\nDisintegration Set\r\n\r\n10 Introduction\r\n11 Plainsong\r\n12 Pictures Of You\r\n13 Closedown\r\n14 Lovesong\r\n15 Last Dance\r\n16 Lullaby\r\n17 Fascination Street\r\n18 Prayers For Rain\r\n19 The Same Deep Water As You\r\n20 Disintegration\r\n21 Homesick\r\n22 Untitled\r\n\r\nDVD2\r\nBloodflowers Set\r\n\r\n1 Introduction\r\n2 Out Of This World\r\n3 Watching Me Fall\r\n4 Where The Birds Always Sing\r\n5 Maybe Someday\r\n6 The Last Day Of Summer\r\n7 There Is No Ifâ€¦\r\n8 The Loudest Sound\r\n9 39\r\n10 Bloodflowers\r\n\r\nEncore Set\r\n\r\n11 If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\r\n12 The Kiss\r\n\r\nInterview","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f729a81a84fb3385db06fbd5837dbe34bf7d063","amp;dn":"The+Cure+%26ndash%3B+Trilogy+-+2003+%282xDVD9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f729a81a84fb3385db06fbd5837dbe34bf7d063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,114,154,129,168,79,179,56,93,176,111,189,88,55,219,227,75,247,208,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
