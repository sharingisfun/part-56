Their host, the widow Renata seems distant and unwelcoming. She comes and goes late at night and wears no shoes, but in spite of these idiosyncrasies Max takes a shine to her. That is, until a spate of disappearances and livestock deaths point to the local legend of a fearsome black dog stalking the countryside.\r\n \r\nRobertâ€™s medication is making him erratic and he soon gets it into his head that Renataâ€™s dead husband and missing son Brant may have been killed. The question is how and why? As they investigate further they uncover a family chapel that brings lots of unanswered questions. Robert suspects that Renata is behind all of the questions and assumes she is part of Tenebrae. Robert and Max capture Renata and Robert goes to search the chapel for the portal. While Max guards Renata he declares himself smitten.\r\n \r\nHave Robert and Max jumped to the correct conclusions about Renata?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71c82aa2c870d80338b76ea468177e6f21d9af0","amp;dn":"Jekyll.and.Hyde.%5B2015%5D.s01e05.EN.SUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71c82aa2c870d80338b76ea468177e6f21d9af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,28,130,170,44,135,13,128,51,139,118,234,70,129,119,230,242,29,154,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
