Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nNote: Proper REUP fixes the previous upload.\r\n\r\nEpisode 277: A freshly coifed Anthony kicks off a new week chatting about Obamaâ€™s gun sales, having actual face to face convos, his weekend gun purchase, the â€œanti-gun crew,â€ and we see a repulsive head wound video that is fucking yuck. We then get into feedback from news outlets regarding Islamic terrorism, coddling hurt muzzies, labeling terrorists, Loretta Lynch, Chicago PD, TJ Sotomayor and shitty names, a dude on Fox News â€œgoing off,â€ we learn about a new suspension, and see Stacey Dash not giving a shit. Anthony talks about Trumpâ€™s live tweeting, the government mystery list, almost being on the â€œNo Fly List,â€ an â€œif you see something say somethingâ€ occurrence, Star Wars, the olâ€™ popcorn gag, the TV show Fargo, train car decorating, Pearl Harbor Day, and Gallagherâ€™s former manager Craig calls in to tell us a bunch of behind the scenes shit on Leo. We hear about a dudeâ€™s life that came apart because of Ashley Madison, Ant reminisces about Beautyâ€™s Hill, he talks about a 9 year oldâ€™s love note, Garrett talks about a past love note, Ant admits he once wrote a love poem, Rat fills us in on Hanukkah and Jew parties, we get introduced to â€œhow many candles,â€ and TACS ends with a few callers and the â€œfuror on the bureau.â€œ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c53a3b9edfd5fc959f6c39752a954b024ef253b","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-07+REUP+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c53a3b9edfd5fc959f6c39752a954b024ef253b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,83,163,185,237,253,95,201,89,246,195,151,82,169,84,176,36,239,37,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
