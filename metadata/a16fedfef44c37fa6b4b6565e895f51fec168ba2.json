Part of our Keepnews Collection, which spotlights classic albums originally produced by the legendary Orrin Keepnews.\r\n\r\nKeepnews was responsible for giving Montgomery his first recording deal, thanks to a tip from Cannonball Adderley. The guitarist made a number of albums for Riverside, but Full House tops them all.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a live date (recorded in Berkeley, Calif., at Tsuboâ€™s) featuring Miles Davisâ€™ rhythm section comprised of pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb and augmented by young tenor saxophone firebrand Johnny Griffin. Montgomery fully stretches out on this date. The original six tracks are complemented by five bonus tracks.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Full House\r\n02 - I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\r\n03 - Blue 'N' Boogie\r\n04 - Cariba (take2)\r\n05 - Come Rain Or Come Shine (take 2)\r\n06 - S.O.S.
