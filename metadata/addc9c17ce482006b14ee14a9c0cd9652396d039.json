Once the voyage is under way, somehow a nuke A) gets lost in the vicinity, and B) goes off. The resulting tidal wave capsizes the cruise ship, and its up to our heros to save the day. \r\n\r\nStarring James Coburn, Costas Mandylor, Finola Hughes\r\n\r\nMany people pick up a film and expect to watch good actors reading a good script. In this movie you will find neither. What you will find is an excellent B-Movie. It has all the good things about any B-movie, action, water, and it doesnt make much sense. If you are looking for some descent action without having to pay attention to the story then this film is perfect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:addc9c17ce482006b14ee14a9c0cd9652396d039","amp;dn":"Deep+Water.2000.DVDRIP.XVID.CG.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"addc9c17ce482006b14ee14a9c0cd9652396d039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,220,156,23,206,72,32,6,177,78,225,74,156,12,217,101,35,150,208,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
