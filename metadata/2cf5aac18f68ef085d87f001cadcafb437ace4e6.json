Believing he is divinely inspired to save his village from the Black Death, he persuades a group of men to follow him into a tunnel. They dig deep into the earth and emerge ... in Auckland, New Zealand, 1987. Following portents, the time travelers must negotiate the terrors of a strange new world, (motorways, nuclear submarines) â€” while seeking to save their own. Nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, it scooped the gongs at the 1988 AFI and 1989 NZ Film &amp; TV Awards.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-navigator-a-mediaeval-odyssey-1988\r\n\r\n\r\nRipped from DVD\r\n\r\n.mkv\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly seed this rare film","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf5aac18f68ef085d87f001cadcafb437ace4e6","amp;dn":"The+Navigator.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf5aac18f68ef085d87f001cadcafb437ace4e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,245,170,193,143,104,239,8,93,135,240,1,202,220,175,180,55,172,228,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
