The film is based on known facts and actual events and required two years of exhaustive research.\r\n\r\nA co-production between Channel 4 in the UK and the CBC in Canada, it was shown in the UK during September 2004, amid criticism that this was too close to the anniversary of the attack. Using computer-generated imagery, the film's producers were able to show the twin towers of the World Trade Center, before the attack, in the background.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x480, 29.970 fps, 1000 Kbps, 01h40m46s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 448 kbps\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio both English movie tracks, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/j2d6q6hlb/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cdyllv7uh/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/xmca3ambd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/l6fk9jszd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/a5kf4j0qh/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ee2e2eb537b1eb08ed151a12c5e3fcdf5afa41","amp;dn":"The+Hamburg+Cell+%282004+-+UK%29+%5B911+hijackers+dramatisation%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ee2e2eb537b1eb08ed151a12c5e3fcdf5afa41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,238,46,46,181,55,177,235,8,237,21,26,18,197,227,252,223,90,250,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
