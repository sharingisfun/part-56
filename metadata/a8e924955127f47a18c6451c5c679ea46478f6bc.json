The film tells the story of a Jewish strongman in Germany. Not to be confused with the martial arts film with Billy Zane. Note that this is intended for play on a computer. Use up-to-date codecs! It has both H.265 video and Opus audio. VLC works and Media Player Classic ought to work too.\r\n\r\nFILM INFORMATION\r\n________________\r\n\r\nTitle: Invincible\r\nYear: 2001\r\nIMDb rating: 6.6\r\nDirector: Werner Herzog\r\nGenre: Drama, War\r\nFeaturing Tim Roth, Jouko Ahola, Anna Gourari\r\nDescription: A Jewish strongman performs in Berlin as the blond Aryan hero Siegfried.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCT\r\n_______\r\n\r\nFormat: DVD\r\nEdition: Theatrical Edition, 127 minutes and 20 seconds\r\nSpoken language: English\r\nSubtitle language: English\r\nVideo language: English title text and subtitles, some German and Hebrew texts in actual film footage\r\nFinal encoded size:\r\n- Invincible: 605MB (547MB video, 55.1MB audio, 85.2kB subtitles)\r\n\r\n\r\nCODECS AND CHANNELS: Invincible\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\n==VIDEO==\r\nVideo codec: HEVC (H.265)\r\nResolution: 720x576\r\nFramerate: 50fps progressive, deinterlaced from i50\r\nAverage bitrate: 600kbps\r\nProcess (automated with various scripts):\r\n- Deinterlaced with QTGMC (Preset=&quot;Very Slow&quot;)\r\n- Denoise with MC Spuds (frames=2,strength=4)\r\n- Encoded with x265 via avs4x265 (preset 9, bitrate 600, deblock 3:2, two-pass)\r\n\r\n==AUDIO==\r\nAudio codec: Opus\r\nChannels: Stereo\r\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\r\nBitrate: 48kbps\r\nProcess (automated with various scripts):\r\n- Decoded AC3 files from DVD to PCM.\r\n- Encoded with OpusEnc (bitrate 48, vbr, comp 10, framesize 60)\r\n\r\n==SUBTITLES==\r\nFormat: SRT\r\nEncoding: UTF-8\r\nLanguage: English, with a few exclamations left in original languages that should be obvious (e.g. &quot;Sieg heil!&quot; or &quot;L'chaim.&quot;).

Framerate is very smooth. Detail is as good as the original source material allows. No noise present. Some visual artifacts are evident, especially in static scenes on I-frames. These then get blurred out in consecutive B-frames, but produce a slightly noticeable jolt sometimes. Edges are blurry when the camera moves due to bad temporal predictions. Audio is good, but not as crisp as the original. Subtitles are extremely accurate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e924955127f47a18c6451c5c679ea46478f6bc","amp;dn":"Invincible.2001.DVDRip.h265-GHOST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e924955127f47a18c6451c5c679ea46478f6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,233,36,149,81,39,244,122,24,198,69,28,92,103,158,164,100,120,246,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
