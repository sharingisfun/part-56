The plot kicks into gear because he's trying to muscle in on the cocaine dealing trade in the South-west of England, which is currently being controlled by another small time gangster called Harris.\r\n\r\nShot on video on weekends over more than two years for around Â£15,000, Darren Ward's Sudden Fury makes up for it's typical SOV faults (low-res image quality, non-actors unconvincingly delivering terrible dialogue, etc.) with a loving dedication to delivering a barrage of spectacularly over-the-top bloody shootings, stabbings and assorted other gory moments. Though its previously been billed as a classic Brit gangster flick, it's clear from the ramped up level of gore drenched action that characterises much of the content of Sudden Fury that writer, director and producer Ward is rather more enamoured of the sort of blood splattered crime flicks that emerged out of Italy in the 1970s and early 1980s.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, this is meant to be a tough crime flick, full of the sort of hardened criminals whose usual mode of greeting would generally consist of casually shooting you in the kneecaps . . . if you're lucky. The script tries to outdo Guy Richie and Tarantino alike by having its entire cast of unsympathetic hard-cases substituting ninety-five per cent of the words in all of their on screen utterances with the F word, leavened with a smattering of the C word just for variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x336, 25.000 fps, 823 Kbps, 01h43m40s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 126 kbps\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 108 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio English with commentary track, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4gmk3mj2x/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5uidgcxw7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/adum1vfrr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/hsjxu91nb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4e6uy7uzb/\r\n\r\ncredit ripper T---------s and source RL, September 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a336cfecdaef2b6757ec934dcf47118242258f","amp;dn":"Sudden+Fury+%281997+-+UK%29+British+gangster+action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a336cfecdaef2b6757ec934dcf47118242258f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,163,54,207,236,218,239,43,103,87,236,147,77,207,71,17,130,66,37,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
