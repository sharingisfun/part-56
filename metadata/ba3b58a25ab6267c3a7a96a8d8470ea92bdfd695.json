He comes out of a small town, locally reputed to be 'the Paris of Madhya Pradesh'. His English is comically Indian, and his initial notions of America are absurdly inadequate and stereotyped. The theme of the novel is his comic discovery of America, and his own growth and maturing through his diverse adventures there. The novel is thus a variation on the form of the bildungsroman with a fool-protagonist, with the difference that the native wit of the protagonist far transcends his linguistic limitations. This novel has thus an acuteness and depth of meaning which go beyond the obvious comic implications of the chosen initial situation.\r\nÂ \r\nAnurag Mathur was born in New Delhi and educated at Scindia School (Gwalior), St Stephen's College (Delhi), and the University of Tulsa (Oklahoma)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba3b58a25ab6267c3a7a96a8d8470ea92bdfd695","amp;dn":"The+Inscrutable+Americans+-+Anurag+Mathur.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba3b58a25ab6267c3a7a96a8d8470ea92bdfd695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,59,88,162,90,182,38,124,58,122,150,168,216,71,14,169,43,223,214,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
