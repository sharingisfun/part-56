However, available information on this rapidly growing field is fragmented among a variety of journals and specialized books.\r\n\r\nNow researchers and medical practitioners have an authoritative and comprehensive source for the latest research and applications in biomedical photonics. Over 150 leading scientists, engineers, and physicians discuss state-of-the-art instrumentation, methods, and protocols in the Biomedical Photonics Handbook. Editor-in-Chief Tuan Vo-Dinh and an advisory board of distinguished scientists and medical experts ensure that each of the 65 chapters represents the latest and most accurate information currently available","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce45900320e6bfa78c016f0a933b929230a565f9","amp;dn":"Biomedical+Photonics+Handbook+-+Tuan+Vo-Dinh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce45900320e6bfa78c016f0a933b929230a565f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,69,144,3,32,230,191,167,140,1,111,10,147,59,146,146,48,165,101,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
