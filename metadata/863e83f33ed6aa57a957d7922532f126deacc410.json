Major topics covered include conduction, convection, radiation, boiling, heat exchangers, and mass transfer and are explained in a detailed, to-the-point manner. Along with coverage of the topics, the author provides appropriate numerical examples to clarify theory and concepts. Exercise problems are presented at the end of each chapter to test the understanding gained within each subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863e83f33ed6aa57a957d7922532f126deacc410","amp;dn":"Elements+of+Heat+Transfer+-+Ethirajan+Rathakrishnan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863e83f33ed6aa57a957d7922532f126deacc410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,62,131,243,62,214,170,87,169,87,215,146,37,50,241,38,222,172,196,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
