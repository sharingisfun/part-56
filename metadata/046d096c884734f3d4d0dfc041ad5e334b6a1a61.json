The game allows you to play at any level from being a small time pirate to the ruler of a large empire. You can fight, trade, explore, build factories, and amass a fleet to form your own faction and conquer others'.\r\n\r\nThe universe is dynamic and fully simulated, NPC ships live their own lives, factions are able to conquer territories and conduct diplomacy while their economy influences their military production and capacity. Missions are generated based on what's actually going on in the galaxy, instead of what is usually the other way around","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:046d096c884734f3d4d0dfc041ad5e334b6a1a61","amp;dn":"Unending+Galaxy+v1.1.0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"046d096c884734f3d4d0dfc041ad5e334b6a1a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,109,9,108,136,71,52,243,212,208,223,192,65,173,94,51,75,106,26,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
