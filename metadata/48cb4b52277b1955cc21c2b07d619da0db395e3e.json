But how much of it was real and how much was adapted for Hollywood fiction?\r\n\r\nPlatoon tells the story of idealistic new recruit Chris Taylor (played by Charlie Sheen) as he embarks on his first tour of duty in the deadly, booby-trapped jungles of Vietnam. The movie sees Taylorâ€™s patriotism crumble within days of joining a platoon of demoralized and battle weary soldiers as they fight a losing battle in one of the most controversial conflicts of the 20th Century.\r\n\r\nInterviewing the movieâ€™s legendary writer and director, Oliver Stone, we discover the true story behind Platoon, uncovering the real life events behind the movie and revealing the identities of the soldiers Stone fought alongside, who he would later immortalize on the big screen. As well as also hearing from Vietnam veteran and former marine, Dale Dye, who Oliver Stone drafted in to be the filmâ€™s military adviser and learn just what the young actors were put through during a gruelling two week boot camp before filming began.\r\n\r\nHistorian Fabian Hilfrich also heads to the Vietnamese jungle where Stone was posted in 1967 to discover the real conditions the troops faced, the deadly booby traps that lay hidden all around and investigates the Viet Congâ€™s Deadly network of underground tunnels that feature prominently in one of the movies tensest scenes.\r\n\r\nWe also dissect Platoonâ€™s climatic battle scene where US Troops bomb their own base in a desperate attempt to fend off an ambush. It was textbook Hollywood jeopardy, but itâ€™s based on an actual event. We reunite Stoneâ€™s comrades who served alongside him that fearsome night, hearing from the man who ordered that napalm attack for real, and revealing exclusive recordings of the actual airstrike that was so famously mirrored in the movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48cb4b52277b1955cc21c2b07d619da0db395e3e","amp;dn":"The.True.Story.s05e02.Platoon.360p.LDTV.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48cb4b52277b1955cc21c2b07d619da0db395e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,203,75,82,39,123,25,85,204,33,194,176,125,97,157,160,219,57,94,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
