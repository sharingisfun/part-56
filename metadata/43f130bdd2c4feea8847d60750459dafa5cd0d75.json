Sparta is run by well-known local character Francis Jones, who has given behind-the-scenes access to himself, his staff and their operations.\r\n\r\nFrancis is a born again Christian and former professional boxer. He is a man with a big personality, and he's on a mission to clean up the streets of Darlington. No job is too small for Sparta Security, and Francis often goes the extra mile to help his clients, with often outrageous but also hilarious consequences.\r\n\r\nFrancis relies on his office team Rachel and Claire, who use their unusual sales techniques to help him find and secure new business. The work they bring in varies from mediating in neighbourhood disputes to guarding against grand larceny at big businesses in the area. Francis employs a number of security staff to work with him, including balaclava-clad ex-forces officers, part-time bouncers and a personal trainer, and together they use a range of unorthodox methods to make Darlington a better place to live.\r\n\r\nIn this episode, Francis arranges a public meeting in his local area to try to drum up interest in the business and enlist community volunteers. He hits the streets to spread the word, but on the day of the meeting the reaction isn't quite what he expected. Apprentice Pembow helps Francis to plan the meeting, but after an error of judgment finds himself in big trouble with the boss. Elsewhere, Francis is still on the trail of Darlington's nuisance bikers, and to try to finally crack the case he lets loose a mysterious new undercover operative","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f130bdd2c4feea8847d60750459dafa5cd0d75","amp;dn":"Rent.a.Cop.s01e06.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f130bdd2c4feea8847d60750459dafa5cd0d75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,241,48,189,210,196,254,234,136,71,214,7,80,69,157,175,165,205,13,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
