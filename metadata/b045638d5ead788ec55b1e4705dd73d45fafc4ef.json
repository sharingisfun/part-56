An estimated 5000 people were killed. Many injured and orphaned children were taken across the border to Iran for treatment - most never saw their families again. Now, almost 30 years later, one of those children makes an emotional return to Halabja to try and find the family she lost.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/The-Lost-Daughter-of-Halabja-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2645Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x660\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.94:1\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~122Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 23 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 464 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged and embedded\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3csy4kt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b045638d5ead788ec55b1e4705dd73d45fafc4ef","amp;dn":"BBC+Our+World+2015+The+Lost+Daughter+of+Halabja+720p+x264+AAC+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b045638d5ead788ec55b1e4705dd73d45fafc4ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,69,99,141,94,173,120,142,197,91,30,71,5,221,115,212,95,175,196,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
