Soon he \r\nlearns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes to team-up \r\nwith the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin; the mathematician Dr. \r\nHarry Adams; and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding to investigate an \r\nunknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight \r\nyears ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the \r\nUFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' \r\nFletcher and Jane Edmunds. Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the \r\nspaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, \r\nthe computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that \r\nbrought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if \r\nthe crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present \r\ndays, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a \r\nmysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface \r\nand the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without \r\ncommunication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his \r\nmanifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive \r\nto the power of the mysterious sphere?\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Dustin Hoffman.\r\n=&gt;-Sharon Stone.\r\n=&gt;-Samuel L Jackson.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Barry Levinson.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Sci-Fi : Mystery : Action.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1998.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.01 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 143 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 14mn.\r\n=&gt;-Sphere 1998................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sphere/\r\n=&gt;-Sphere 1998................: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sphere-1998/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 800.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 010 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 156 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee12c317ed15df8993268550d8208cf0d2c49005","amp;dn":"Sphere+-+Dustin+Hoffman+Sci-Fi+1998+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee12c317ed15df8993268550d8208cf0d2c49005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,18,195,23,237,21,223,137,147,38,133,80,216,32,140,240,210,196,144,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
