Check my account for more bootlegs.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones\r\nHampton '81\r\nHampton Road Colliseum, VA, \r\nDecember 18th, 1981\r\nTattoo You Tour\r\n(Keiths Birthday)\r\n\r\n\r\nPPV Broadcast &gt; ? &gt; Jointrip Motion Pictures &gt; Purchased at Record Show &gt; Copy to HD &gt; Traders Little Helper for MD5 &gt; Gspot for stats\r\n\r\nAs with all Jointrip productions (at least the ones I've seen) there is a black box around the\r\nactual video giving a 16:9 &quot;look&quot;, I see the black box when I watch on my computer but when I \r\nwatch it on my Sony Widescreen TV the box mysteriously is not visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo System: NTSC 29.97\r\nVideo Bitrate: 6353\r\nVideo Format: 4:3 - 720X480\r\nAudio Codec: LPCM\r\nRunning Time: 190 minutes approx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc One\r\n\r\nTake The &quot;A&quot; Train\r\nUnder My Thumb\r\nWhen The Whip Comes Down\r\nLet's Spend The Night Together\r\nShattered\r\nNeighbors\r\nBlack Limousine\r\nJust My Imagination\r\nTenty Flight Rock\r\nGoing To a Go-Go\r\nLet Me Go\r\nTime Is On My Side\r\nBeast of Burden\r\nWaiting on a Friend\r\nLet It Bleed\r\n\r\nDisc Two\r\n\r\nMick\r\nYou Can't Always Get What You Want\r\nBand Intros\r\nHappy Birthday Keith\r\nLittle T&amp;A\r\nTumbling Dice\r\nShe's So Cold\r\nHang Fire\r\nMiss You\r\nHonky Tonk Woman\r\nBrown Sugar\r\nStart Me Up\r\nJumpin' Jack Flash\r\nSatisfaction\r\nStar-Spangled Banner\r\nHail Hail Rock N' Roll\r\n\r\n\r\nThe noteriety of this show is that when the band began the encore, &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, \r\nthousands of balloons were released and a fan, taking advantage of the confusion, ran past \r\nsecurity and onto the stage, directly at Keith Richards, who proved that they don't call \r\nguitars &quot;Axes&quot; for nothing! The best part is that Keith nails the guy with a Telecaster, \r\nthen puts it back on and keeps playing!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seen a couple single disc versions of this, obviously this is the Double DVD version\r\n7804x5203 scan of cover art is in the torrent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have time to download it try and find time to say thanks! It's appreciated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be457056fe28175a27ac25c2f825ddba8ec50e48","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Hampton+-+1981","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be457056fe28175a27ac25c2f825ddba8ec50e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,69,112,86,254,40,23,90,39,172,37,194,248,37,221,186,142,197,14,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
