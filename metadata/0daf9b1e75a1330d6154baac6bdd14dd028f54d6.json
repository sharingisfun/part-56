These programs and drivers include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. Autoruns reports Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more. Autoruns goes way beyond other autostart utilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutoruns' Hide Signed Microsoft Entries option helps you to zoom in on third-party auto-starting images that have been added to your system and it has support for looking at the auto-starting images configured for other accounts configured on a system. Also included in the download package is a command-line equivalent that can output in CSV format, Autorunsc.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll probably be surprised at how many executables are launched automatically!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0daf9b1e75a1330d6154baac6bdd14dd028f54d6","amp;dn":"Autoruns+for+Windows+v13.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0daf9b1e75a1330d6154baac6bdd14dd028f54d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,175,155,30,117,161,51,13,97,84,186,172,107,221,20,221,2,143,84,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
