He actually posted the last 3 weeks of episodes since I fell so far behind. The only reason I'm still uploading this as these episodes are ripped/watched and the descriptions already written up so I figured I may as well. BBReach has 720p rips of Stossel coming so CHECK HIS PROFILE OUT!!\r\n\r\nthepiratebay[.]mn/user/BBreach/\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nI've made my rips a little bit smaller.

Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL &quot;REALITY&quot;\r\n\r\nFriday at 8PM ET on Fox Business\r\n\r\n&quot;HONEST&quot; POLITICIANS: Authenticity has become the buzzword this presidential election. So I asked people, &quot;Are politicians real? Or fake?&quot; The politician most often named as &quot;not fake&quot; was Donald Trump. I debate &quot;real vs fake&quot; with Presidential historian David Greenberg and Real Clear Politics' Rebecca Berg.\r\n\r\nWAR OVERSEAS: Presidential candidate Lindsey Graham wants more military spending and troops sent to more countries. How will he pay for it? Do our troops create more problems than they solve? Did they create ISIS? Graham and I debate.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION: Some Republican Presidential candidates say immigrants take American jobs. Is that true? Economist Ben Powell, author of &quot;The Economics of Immigration&quot; says it's true but misleading. People confuse the &quot;seen&quot; and the &quot;unseen.&quot; In the long run, immigrants create more jobs than they take.\r\n\r\nWAR ON COPS: Many in the media say &quot;there's a war on cops!&quot; People believe more cops are being killed, but actually, that's not true. Nevertheless, police officers face new obstacles. Former NYPD Lt./Commander Joe Cardinale talks about whether the war on cops is real.\r\n\r\nWAR ON WOMEN: Democrats talk about the Republican &quot;War on Women,&quot; but how much of that is a political myth? Do women have a right for government to pay for their birth control? Abortions? I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMY TAKE: I get heat from libertarians because I don't hate the NSA data-mining. But am I naÃ¯ve? Look what government did to Jason Chaffetz: the congressman once was turned down for a job at the Secret Service, and after he upset them, dozens of people at the Secret Service accessed and gossiped about his personal information. Then someone leaked it. No one at the Secret Service has been prosecuted for this. Government grows, abuses power, and rarely apologizes. That's political reality.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name : Stossel.2015.10.09.Political.Reality.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media\r\nCodec ID : isom\r\nFile size : 247 MiB\r\nDuration : 41mn 7s\r\nOverall bit rate : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration : 41mn 6s\r\nBit rate : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth : 624 pixels\r\nHeight : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Variable\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.106\r\nStream size : 206 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 41mn 7s\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 37.6 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ec3a3286d4ffccd98824aba61b86065007771c","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.10.09.Political.Reality.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ec3a3286d4ffccd98824aba61b86065007771c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,236,58,50,134,212,255,204,217,136,36,171,166,27,134,6,80,7,119,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
