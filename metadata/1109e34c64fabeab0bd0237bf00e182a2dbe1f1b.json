Hinton novel re-imagined as \n         a surreal, righteously furious thriller. At the tender age of 15, \n         Aila (Kawennahere Devery Jacobs) has taken over the drug business \n         of her father Joseph (Glen Gould) while he serves a stint in \n         prison. Joseph s return signals an abrupt end to Aila s reign as \n         the reservation s drug queen; it also piques the interest of \n         Popper (Mark Antony Krupa), the reserve s corrupt and sadistic \n         Indian agent. The bloody tragedy that unfolds becomes an angry \n         and poetic howl for lost lives, lost opportunities and lost loved \n         ones a fever dream whose terrifying fictions are grounded in even \n         more terrible fact.\n         \n           LOOKING FOR   \n\n\n           - .pl ,.ro ,.hu ,.no ,.cz sites, ask around if you cant find us :D\n           - 10mbit + dump for private usage\n           - TV-DVD / DVDR / x264 suplliers\n           - Experienced xvid / bluray rippers / encoders\n           \n\n            GREETZ      \n\n\n            731 , CHRONO, SYS, AVCHD, AVCDVD , UNTOUCHABLES, Ltu, EFFECT, WaLMaRT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1109e34c64fabeab0bd0237bf00e182a2dbe1f1b","amp;dn":"Rhymes.For.Young.Ghouls.2013.BDRip.x264-PFa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1109e34c64fabeab0bd0237bf00e182a2dbe1f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,9,227,76,100,250,190,171,11,208,35,123,240,14,24,42,45,190,31,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
