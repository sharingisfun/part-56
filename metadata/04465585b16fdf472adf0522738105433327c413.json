I had no idea Roger was going to be so close by.\r\nI thought what is he doing and why would such a huge rock star be playing for such a small crowd in a tiny town\r\nthat never has musicians playing? Well except that time back in 1991 when I saw Foghat on the beach.\r\nOtherwise having Roger Waters in Old Lyme was strange and exciting.\r\nThen out of the blue, late last night I get a file transfer from my taping friend Ken G. (who is now retired) and\r\nif I thought he went to a lot of concerts before, seems to now be attending concerts at a fevered pitch.\r\nWhich is a bonus for any music fan/collector.\r\nKen says security was breathing down his neck and a strict no recording of any kind policy.\r\nThe recording came out as good as you might expect with a somewhat quiet stage volume and louder crowd response.\r\nIt's cool that GE Smith is involved, delivery some great electric guitar.\r\nKen did all the tracking, I did some additional editing by lowering the crowd cheer and boosting the music.\r\nBig thanks goes out to Ken for his recording and efforts.\r\n01 Introduction\r\n02 When The Tigers Broke Free\r\n03 Mother\r\n04 Poem\r\n05 Crystal Clear Brooks\r\n06 Hello in There\r\n07 Blowin' In The Wind\r\n08 Safe and Sound\r\n09 We Shall Overcome\r\n10 Roger Talking\r\n11 Poem\r\n12 Wish You Were Here\r\n13 Comfortably Numb\r\n14 Lay Down Jerusalem\r\n15 Forever Young\r\n\r\nTotal Time = 101:32 min\r\nEnjoy\r\nGeorge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04465585b16fdf472adf0522738105433327c413","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+2015-10-30+Bay+Street+Theater%2C+Sag+Harbor%2C+NY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04465585b16fdf472adf0522738105433327c413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,70,85,133,177,111,223,71,42,223,5,34,115,129,5,67,51,39,196,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
