Liu (Wiley, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9780471709077\r\n\r\nA unique, comprehensive reference that integrates the molecular, cellular, physiological, pathological, and engineering aspects of regenerative processes Bioregenerative engineering is an emerging discipline based on applying engineering principles and technologies to regenerative medicine. It induces, modulates, enhances, and/or controls regenerative processes by using engineering approaches to improve the restoration of the structure and function of disordered or lost molecules, cells, tissues, and organs. This reference systematically summarizes bioregenerative engineering principles, technologies, and current research to help scientists understand biological regeneration and design new therapeutic strategies. Succinct and well-organized with a detailed table of contents to help readers pinpoint information, this reference: Provides the fundamental theory and principles of molecular, cellular, and tissue regenerative engineering concurrently with experimental approaches Presents the foundations of bioregenerative engineering, encompassing the molecular basis, the regulatory mechanism of regeneration, and the developmental aspects Combines molecular and cell biology with potential applications Addresses experimental design, methods, and modeling at the molecular/cellular/tissue levels Covers the general mechanisms and technologies of bioregenerative engineering, as well as its application to the treatment of human disorders Discusses the engineering tests and therapies for major organ systems Presenting an in-depth introduction to the biological and engineering aspects of the field and an up-to-date overview of current research, this is a one-of-a-kind resource for scientific researchers and medical practitioners, as well as for graduate and undergraduate students in biomedical engineering, bioengineering, chemical engineering, molecular biology, and cell biology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a51e0e005493ddd041b1ff288e9f3165909b780","amp;dn":"Bioregenerative+Engineering+-+Principles+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a51e0e005493ddd041b1ff288e9f3165909b780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,81,224,224,5,73,61,221,4,27,31,242,136,233,243,22,89,9,183,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
