Current, comprehensive, and concise, it covers bioseparations unit operations in unprecedented depth. In each of the chapters, the authors use a consistent method of explaining unit operations, starting with a qualitative description noting the significance and general application of the unit operation. They then illustrate the scientific application of the operation, develop the required mathematical theory, and finally, describe the applications of the theory in engineering practice, with an emphasis on design and scaleup. Unique to this text is a chapter dedicated to bioseparations process design and economics, in which a process simular, SuperPro DesignerÂ® is used to analyze and evaluate the production of three important biological products. \r\n\r\nNew to this second edition are updated discussions of moment analysis, computer simulation, membrane chromatography, and evaporation, among others, as well as revised problem sets. Unique features include basic information about bioproducts and engineering analysis and a chapter with bioseparations laboratory exercises. Bioseparations Science and Engineering is ideal for students and professionals working in or studying bioseparations, and is the premier text in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23bdb3618ae76fc5152ae1808522431c7cce9b99","amp;dn":"Bioseparations+Science+and+Engineering+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23bdb3618ae76fc5152ae1808522431c7cce9b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,189,179,97,138,231,111,197,21,42,225,128,133,34,67,28,124,206,155,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
