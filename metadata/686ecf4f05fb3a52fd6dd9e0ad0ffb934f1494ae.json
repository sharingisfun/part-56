Do not use this patch for playing on an SOE Live server as it will most likely get your account banned seeing that these are NOT original SOE files, but custom files created for EQEmu solely.\r\n\r\nYou have been warned.\r\n\r\nList of bugfixes:\r\n\r\nNorth Freeport sounds glitch\r\nWest Freeport sound glitch\r\nNorthern Desert of Ro sound glitch\r\nSouthern Desert of Ro sound glitch\r\nOasis of Marr sound glitch\r\nSolusek Temple sound glitch\r\nMissing/Glitched spell sound effects\r\nWeapon, Armor, Shield, graphic/animation glitching\r\nDrakkin animation script glitch\r\nFreeport Academy script glitch\r\nBlackburrow missing/bugged graphics\r\nBastion of Thunder missing/bugged graphics\r\nNorth Freeport missing/bugged graphics\r\nWest Freeport missing/bugged graphics\r\nTower of the Frozen Shadow missing/bugged graphics\r\nGuk missing/bugged graphics\r\nNorthern Desert of Ro missing/bugged graphics\r\nOasis of Marr missing/bugged graphics\r\nOcean of Tears missing/bugged graphics\r\nPlane of Fire missing/bugged graphics\r\nPlane of Storms missing/bugged graphics\r\nPlane of Water missing/bugged graphics\r\nQvic Prayer Grounds missing/bugged graphics\r\nRathe Mountains missing/bugged graphics\r\nSouthern Desert of Ro missing/bugged graphics\r\nBastion of Thunder data scripting errors\r\nDreadlands data scripting errors\r\nWestern Freeport data scripting errors\r\nGuk data scripting errors\r\nGulf of Gunthak data scripting errors\r\nNorthern Desert of Ro data scripting errors\r\nOasis of Marr data scripting errors\r\nPlane of Knowledge data scripting errors\r\nQvic Prayer Grounds data scripting errors\r\nMissing PC/NPC Race Data scripting errors\r\nMissing Spell Data scripting errors\r\nSouthern Desert of Ro Data scripting errors\r\nBastion of Thunder missing backgroud music track\r\nMissing Northern Freeport character mapping references\r\nMissing Western Freeport character mapping references\r\nMissing northern Desert of Ro character mapping references\r\nMissing Citadel of the Worldslayer zone references\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Sven Ecklemann for all his information on the creation and editing of S3D files and his 1,000,001 tutorials!
