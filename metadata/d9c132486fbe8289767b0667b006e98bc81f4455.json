This Japanese method of decorating and firing dates back to the 16th century and requires the potters to take their red-hot vases straight out of the kiln and plunge them into a bin full of combustible materials.\r\n\r\nFor their spot test, the potters must produce the finest decoration on three jugs using slip - watered-down clay. It is an ancient method which first enabled potters to colour and pattern their work. And for the throw down, the potters have just 15 minutes at the wheel to produce exact copies of two ornate candlesticks thrown by master potter Keith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c132486fbe8289767b0667b006e98bc81f4455","amp;dn":"The.Great.Pottery.Throw.Down-S01E03-BBC--720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c132486fbe8289767b0667b006e98bc81f4455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,193,50,72,111,190,130,137,118,123,6,103,176,6,233,139,200,31,68,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
