Throwing, trimming and decorating are just some of the stages of the make. The potters' every move is watched over by judges Kate Malone and Keith Brymer Jones, while Sara Cox makes them feel right at home in the heart of the Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent.\r\n\r\nWhile they wait for their bowls to dry and fire, the potters face two more challenges of their potting skill. The Spot Test is a chance to show off their technical ability against the clock. This week, they must make and attach handles onto twenty mugs using a technique called pulling - with mixed and amusing results.\r\n\r\nAnd in the Throw Down, the judges test the potters' skill at the wheel. This week, they must throw as many egg cups as they can in twenty minutes. They must throw 'off the hump' - a technique which helped to bring about modern-day mass production of small pots. But which potter will make the most?\r\n\r\nOn the last day, the potters' bowls finally come out of the kiln and they see whether all their hard work has paid off. Who will be this week's top potter? And who will be the first to leave the pottery?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:714cba845ef9cc17937f35ea07b551848c63a712","amp;dn":"The.Great.Pottery.Throw.Down-S01E01--BBC-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"714cba845ef9cc17937f35ea07b551848c63a712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,76,186,132,94,249,204,23,147,127,53,234,7,181,81,132,140,99,167,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
