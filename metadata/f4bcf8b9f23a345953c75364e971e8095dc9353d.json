This Third Edition reflects how the chemistry and technology of lubricants has developed since the First Edition was published in 1992.\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of performance development in the past 35 years has been as significant as in the previous century: Refinery processes have become more precise in defining the physical and chemical properties of higher quality mineral base oils. New and existing additives have improved performance through enhanced understanding of their action. Specification and testing of lubricants has become more focused and rigorous.\r\n\r\n&quot;Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants&quot; is directed principally at those working in the lubricants industry as well as individuals working within academia seeking a chemist's viewpoint of lubrication. It is also of value to engineers and technologists requiring a more fundamental understanding of the subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4bcf8b9f23a345953c75364e971e8095dc9353d","amp;dn":"Chemistry+and+Technology+of+Lubricants+3rd+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4bcf8b9f23a345953c75364e971e8095dc9353d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,188,248,185,242,58,52,89,83,199,83,100,233,113,232,9,93,201,53,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
