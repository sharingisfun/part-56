But he was also an excellent composer of knotty and\r\nmemorable melodies, especially on his universally acknowledged masterpiece Out\r\nTo Lunch. It is the melodic content of this great album that is the inspiration\r\nfor the interpretations by Russ Johnson on trumpet, Myra Melford on piano, Roy\r\nNathanson on saxophone, Brad Jones on bass, and George Schuller on drums. It is\r\ninteresting to hear Myra Melford trying to take on the roll that vibraphonist\r\nBobby Hutcherson held on the original LP. On the Thelonious Monk tribute &quot;Hat\r\nand Beard&quot; she brings a very interesting viewpoint, using her own considerable\r\nskill to make for an arresting performance. Johnson takes the lead on melodic\r\n&quot;Something Sweet, Something Tender&quot; playing in both a punchy and thoughtful\r\nmanner. The complex Dolphy composition &quot;Out To Lunch&quot; is one of the highlights\r\nof the album, making space for Jones to anchor the music while Schuller makes\r\nthe most of the march rhythm of the original recording. Dolphy's flute feature\r\n&quot;Gazzeloni&quot; is moved into a different direction with swirling trumpet and\r\nsaxophone and muscular bass powering the performance along. This album worked\r\nreally well, demonstrating the enduring beauty of Eric Dolphy's music, while\r\nallowing these talented musicians to make their own mark.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Peter Margasak \nhttp://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/russ-johnsons-still-out-to-lunch/Event?oid=15250453\r\n\r\nBy Kevin Lynch \nhttp://nodepression.com/album-review/trumpeter-russ-johnson-reimagines-eric-dolphys-classic-album-out-lunch\r\n\r\nBy Howard Reich \nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/reich/ct-brock-johnson-review-20141019-column.html\r\n\r\nBy Howard Mandel \nhttp://www.artsjournal.com/jazzbeyondjazz/2008/03/out_to_lunch_in_the_zone.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74185bef65f63781ed603675ce7729176ee0f7a7","amp;dn":"Russ+Johnson+-+Still+Out+To+Lunch%21+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74185bef65f63781ed603675ce7729176ee0f7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,24,91,239,101,246,55,129,237,96,54,117,206,119,41,23,110,224,247,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
