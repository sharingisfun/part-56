I looked everywhere online but could not find either a torrent nor a place that sells it. Maybe I didn't look hard enough but I digress, the internet has another archived book. It even has some fancypants illustrations that look archaic, cool, and hand done. \r\n\r\n-Title: Wonderful Inventions and Discoveries in Heat, Light, and Sound\r\n\r\n-Author: Ward, Lock, &amp; Co.\r\n\r\n-Year:Unspecified, but my guess is some time around ~1880-1940\r\n\r\n-Size: 43.656mb\r\n\r\n-Format:'.djvu', I wanted it to stay in .pdf format but it was literally 1gb and that was ridiculous so I chose .djvu because of the extreme file compression algorithms.\r\n\r\n-Pages: 347 all up, book is split into three sections (heat, light, and sound)\r\n\r\nSynopsis (no official synopsis used):\r\nThis book is about the wonderful inventions and discoveries of the time period of the books writing. It covers things from mathematical games, different elements and the uses for heat, an in-depth discussion about light, refraction, the eyes perception, cool tricks used with this exploitation (even making real ghosts), and fun tricks to do with sound. It also covers some mechanisms for performing these tricks.\r\n\r\n-Issues:\r\nIntro: vii is slightly blurry (abbreviated hence as 'sB')\r\nSection 1: 31 (sB) \r\nSection 2: 53-58 missing before book was retrieved, 69 (sB), 75 (sB), 85 (sB), 105 (sB)\r\nSection 3: ix (sB), 21 (sB), 31 (sB), 33 (sB), 57 (sB) \r\n\r\n-Images: \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/28rz6vmis/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84cfbf31d40593a2ee608ce62f6f9aaabbcdd4ab","amp;dn":"Wonderful+Inventions+and+Discoveries+by+Ward%2C+Lock+%26amp%3B+Co.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84cfbf31d40593a2ee608ce62f6f9aaabbcdd4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,207,191,49,212,5,147,162,238,96,140,230,47,111,154,170,187,205,212,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
