After Maggie and George agree on separate vacations at the resort, Maggie begins to fall for Dr. Phillip Luce. George begins his own flirtations with Gloria. George and Maggie decide to file for a quickie divorce, an island specialty, and end up at the office of Antonio Rivera. After trying to convince them to seek his services as a marriage counselor instead, he tells them the papers will be processed in 48 hours.

I'll see 100 people downloading and then activity goes to zero once they all get what they want.  It's unfortunate!  But, I seed my torrents 24/7, unless I'm doing a reboot or we experience a power outage.  If you start downloading one of my posts and it comes to a halt, don't give up on it, I'll be back online as soon as 'the internet God' allows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3442c4bd3a74dab0153ace84155a162f263f737","amp;dn":"Second+Honeymoon+%282001%29+Roma+Downey+%5BHALLMARK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3442c4bd3a74dab0153ace84155a162f263f737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,68,44,75,211,167,77,171,1,83,172,232,65,85,161,98,242,99,247,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
