Malachy McCourt, Jacquelyn Mitchard, and 22 more share hilarious and moving stories of confronting death. Exit Laughing makes death more approachable as it reveals the funny side of â€œpassing on.â€ As painful as it is to lose a loved one, Exit Laughing shows us that in times of grief, humor can help us with coping and even healing. \r\n\r\nBest-selling author Amy Ferris explains how her motherâ€™s dementia led to a permanent ban from an airline. Ellen Sussman writes of flying her mother's body home and watching the burial wardrobe spill out on the baggage carousel. Broadway and television actor Richard McKenzie shares the riotous story of a funeral procession led by a lost hearse. Bonnie Garvin even manages to find a heavy dose of dark humor in her parentsâ€™ three unsuccessful attempts at a double suicide. These stories, along with tales from Joshua Braff, Barbara Graham, Dianne Rinehart, and more, constitute a book whose purpose is to remind readers that when dealing with illness, aging, and dying, there is an important place for laugh-out-loud humor.\r\n\r\n[/color][/i][/center]\r\n \r\n[center][img]https://yuq.me/users/27/445/coq1ptWaDL.png[/img]\r\n \r\n[url=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/in/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html&quot;][img]https://yuq.me/users/27/445/lMwVzojU0T.png[/img][/url] [url=&quot;http://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot;][img]https://yuq.me/users/27/445/xZic73afgC.png[/img][/url] [url=&quot;http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html&quot;][img]https://yuq.me/users/27/445/LAipIcdtlq.png[/img][/url][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5185053dccf292b2002ca7cd8959b8dbf4d61194","amp;dn":"Exit+Laughing+-+Victoria+Zackheim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5185053dccf292b2002ca7cd8959b8dbf4d61194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,133,5,61,204,242,146,178,0,44,167,205,137,89,184,219,244,214,17,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
