These lies can seriously damage a relationship and can wreak havoc on the lives of everyone involved. MTV Suspect is the show that tackles these deceptions head on. Every episode, Nev Schulman (Catfish) and his co-host, iO Tillett Wright will work to untangle a new web of lies in the hopes of bringing resolution to our concerned truth-seekers who have nowhere else to turn. Nev and iO will examine the facts, seek out answers and push to uncover whatâ€™s really going on, delving into everything from secret identities, hidden addictions, to a host of other lies that could have hugely damaging consequences. Through this process they hope to help bring the truth to the surface in order for these groups to move into a better and more honest relationship.\r\n\r\nSeason 1, Episode 1 â€“ â€œAllen &amp; Jonathan and Kristen &amp; Thomasâ€\r\nA reality series that uncovers peopleâ€™s secret lives on behalf of their friends and family. In the premiere, a man thinks a friend is concealing an illness; and a woman believes her stepbrother has a drinking problem.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/45/364/53ilwPLmRM.gif[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e2527955294fda1c006425a81571901777ba95","amp;dn":"MTV+Suspect+S01E01+AAC-Mobile+-%3D%7BSPARROW%7D%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e2527955294fda1c006425a81571901777ba95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,226,82,121,85,41,79,218,28,0,100,37,168,21,113,144,23,119,186,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
