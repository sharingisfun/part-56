Was she really as lonely as River thought? As he tries to survive the torment of an uncontrollable manifest, a concerned Rosa encourages River to start attending a group she runs for like-minded troubled souls, with mixed results.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a drunken evening at Chrissie's reveals that River may not be the only one with a less-than-perfect personal life. And when he discovers the surprising identity of someone Stevie spoke to the night she died, it looks like he's blown the case wide open.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/11/04/3ce85f859f9782e0c4dc18d802b74746.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949a5339224e49a78955748a414243c0a70c680d","amp;dn":"River.s01e04.EN.SUB.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949a5339224e49a78955748a414243c0a70c680d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,154,83,57,34,78,73,167,137,85,116,138,65,66,67,192,167,12,104,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
