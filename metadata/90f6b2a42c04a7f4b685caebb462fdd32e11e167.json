He also takes in a tithe barn in Bude, and discovers how an unsightly old building in Penzance found a new lease of life after being converted into a spacious apartment.\r\n\r\n2)  North Yorkshire \r\nArchitectural designer Charlie Luxton travels the historic coastline of North Yorkshire, beginning in Whitby, where Bram Stoker brought Dracula ashore and a young James Cook learnt his seafaring trade before his first Pacific voyage of discovery. In Fylingthorpe, Charlie visits a Scandinavian inspired eco-house and, in Staithes, he encounters a fisherman's cottage with a ship's mast.\r\n\r\n3)  Channel Islands \r\nCharlie Luxton leaves behind mainland Britain and heads to the Channel Islands, as his quest to visit impressive seaside homes continues. On Guernsey's Jerbourg peninsula, he takes in a remodelled clifftop villa, and an old windmill that once served as the home of French writer Victor Hugo during his time of exile on the island. Later, on Jersey, he examines a converted railway station at Corbiere, and a medieval church on St Brelade's Bay.\r\n\r\n4)  Solway Coast, Scotland \r\nCharlie Luxton examines properties on the Solway coast of Dumfries and Galloway, including a modern home that sits on top of a 100 foot cliff in Sandyhills Bay. He also heads for the picturesque port of Kirkcudbright, where he explores a home that takes its inspiration partly from local lighthouses and a Russian architectural masterpiece. Plus, a restored 15th century tower house at Barholm, near Gatehouse of Fleet, and a shoreline Cotswolds-style house at Arbigland.\r\n\r\n5)  Essex \r\nCharlie visits the Discovery Coast of Essex, beginning at the quayside in Maldon on a Thames barge and his first port of call is a small wooden shack that's been converted into a two-bedroomed seaside home. He also visits a development with swathes of glass and recessed balconies. On Mersea Island, he views a converted bungalow, an art deco refurbishment on the seafront, and a detached Victorian villa in Leigh-on-Sea.\r\n\r\n6)  The Solent \r\nCharlie visits seaside homes on the Solent, including a glass palace in St Lawrence on the Isle of Wight, and the Bauhaus-inspired houses of Hamble-le-Rice, Hampshire.\r\n\r\n7)  Northern Ireland \r\nCharlie heads to Northern Ireland and the Antrim Coast. In Hollywood, he meets Robin and Julie, who have built a contemporary home that's almost invisible and looks like it could belong to a secret agent. There's also a converted artists' colony, a restored Victorian house on the seafront and a renovation project in Carnlough that could use a bit of advice. And in Portrush, Charlie visits a modern home with a view of the surf.\r\n\r\n8)  Dorset \r\nCharlie visits a millionaire's pad in Sandbanks, near Poole. There's also a magical boat house, a mini-mansion in Lilliput, and an oyster farm on Chesil Beach.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0e/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/65/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Homes-by-the-Sea-Series-2-Screen14.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3213 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.05 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/c6qxqf/homes-by-the-sea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f6b2a42c04a7f4b685caebb462fdd32e11e167","amp;dn":"Ch4+Homes+By+The+Sea+Series+2+2of8+North+Yorkshire+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f6b2a42c04a7f4b685caebb462fdd32e11e167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,246,178,164,44,4,167,244,182,133,202,235,180,98,253,211,46,17,225,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
