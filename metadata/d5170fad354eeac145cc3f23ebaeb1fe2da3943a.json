It's mainly for the younger children, but adults can watch it too. The puppetry is nothing short of top-notch, and to be honest: I still have no clue how they manage to pull off the 'full-body'-moves of Small. You don't see a puppeteer and yet -- he has a life of his own. Same counts for Big. You only can wonder how they do that.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is a children's' show, but don't be fooled! Even parents can learn a thing or two. Even the occasional songs are catchy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5170fad354eeac145cc3f23ebaeb1fe2da3943a","amp;dn":"Big.and.Small.48eps.Xvid-AJAXEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5170fad354eeac145cc3f23ebaeb1fe2da3943a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,23,15,173,53,78,234,193,69,204,63,35,235,174,177,254,45,163,148,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
