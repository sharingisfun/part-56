After settling in the UK, Ngawang performed as a highly sought after singer amongst the Tibetan Diaspora in Europe but was picked up by BBC Radio 3 in April 2015 in the inaugural year of a BBC Introducing World Music scheme.\r\n\r\nIn this intimate documentary portrait Ngawang speaks openly about his life and career, the pain of exile from his country and family and the central role that music plays in his life. This film tells Ngawangâ€™s incredible story through a mix of interviews, archive footage and behind the scenes access along with live performances from Radio 3, Womad festival and the O2.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/11/05/2ed72a9a6ffa8740d0ece9db4fc6cf90.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFrom BBC Introducing artist to performing at the Dalai Lamaâ€™s public talk at the O2 Arena in just 6 months â€“ This is the story of Ngawang Lodupâ€™s remarkable rise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb26dde67c1cb8cd26410d8ae10d97ad44fd91f","amp;dn":"From.Buddhist.Monk.to.Rock.Star.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb26dde67c1cb8cd26410d8ae10d97ad44fd91f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,178,109,222,103,193,203,140,210,100,16,216,174,16,217,122,212,79,217,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
