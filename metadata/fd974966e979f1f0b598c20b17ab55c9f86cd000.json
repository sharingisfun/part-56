These episodes are no longer available through typical mediums and I have had a surprisingly difficult time tracking them down. All of these episodes were downloaded from YouTube and converted to .mp3 using XMedia Recode.\r\n\r\nI have not personally listened to most of these files and apologize in advance for any errors. I am still trying to locate missing episodes and will upload a complete collection of first 51 episodes when they are found. Any help tracking down missing episodes, or nudge in the right direction, is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed listening to these podcasts when they were available and have been kicking myself for not downloading them when I had the chance. If you are not familiar with O&amp;A or the O&amp;A Podcast, I would personally recommend starting out with Episode #36 Jim Norton Hates Animals, too funny.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n \nhttps://www.siriusxm.com/opieradio\r\n \nhttps://oapedia.com/oa/Opie_and_Anthony","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd974966e979f1f0b598c20b17ab55c9f86cd000","amp;dn":"The+Opie+and+Anthony+Podcast+Episodes+1-51+many+episodes+missing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd974966e979f1f0b598c20b17ab55c9f86cd000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,151,73,102,233,121,241,240,181,152,194,11,23,171,85,201,248,108,208,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
