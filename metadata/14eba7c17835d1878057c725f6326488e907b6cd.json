Quirky &quot;Werewolf&quot; differs in that it is built with Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf binary DEBs.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that the mere fact of using Ubuntu DEBs does not make Quirky a clone of Ubuntu. Nothing could be further from the truth. \r\n\r\nQuirky Werewolf behaves just like the April series, with the one difference that packages can be installed from the Ubuntu DEB repositories. The binary compatibility with Ubuntu offers a huge collection of packages, which is the main attraction of this series.\r\n\r\nmore info:\r\n \nhttp://bkhome.org/news/?viewDetailed=00292","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14eba7c17835d1878057c725f6326488e907b6cd","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Quirky_Werewolf_archive_15-Nov-2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14eba7c17835d1878057c725f6326488e907b6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,235,167,193,120,53,209,135,128,87,199,37,246,50,100,136,233,7,182,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
