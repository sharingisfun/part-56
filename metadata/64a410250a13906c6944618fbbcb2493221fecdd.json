It stands as one of the earliest of a series of pigeonhole-defying, preconception-altering pictures which would later grow to define everything adventurous, unconventional and memorable about British cinema over the ensuing decade.\r\n\r\nThe story opens with an unnamed young couple being shown into a hotel room where they hope to consummate their illicit affair during the lunch hour away from their jobs at Amalgamated Wallpapers. The central narrative spins out into flashback, showing how they both met in the factory and incorporates his desperate search for a place for them to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 672x400, 25.000 fps, 1897 Kbps, 01h00m48s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 320 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles English, English hearing-impaired, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cwc4l4ly1/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/r73nvgsal/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/l8pul89bx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/qyaoja4vx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/v4qxkvf3x/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a410250a13906c6944618fbbcb2493221fecdd","amp;dn":"Lunch+Hour+%281961+-+UK%29+%5BES+subs%5D+classic+British+cinema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a410250a13906c6944618fbbcb2493221fecdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,164,16,37,10,19,144,108,105,68,97,143,187,203,36,147,34,31,236,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
