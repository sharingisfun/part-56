It takes place in a futuristic world, inside of your computer, where the viral threat could lead to catastrophic system failure. You play the role of Flash Bios, who pilots a virus fighting vessel called the Scandisc. You must strategically deploy virus fighting robots called Bits, and protect them while they clean up the virus. Where will you put them? Choose wisely because the virus spreads faster down the data paths and if it reaches the Data Stream it will corrupt the whole system!\r\n\r\nBit Shifter has a retro arcade feel and a unique blend of action and strategy elements. The intuitive flight model and the simple strategic premise allow a player to jump right in and have fun while slowly building skills for more advanced play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32851d05a17aff1572bd0e8aee6e0b19ac57e9c","amp;dn":"Bit+Shifter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32851d05a17aff1572bd0e8aee6e0b19ac57e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,40,81,208,90,23,175,241,87,43,208,232,174,230,224,177,154,197,126,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
