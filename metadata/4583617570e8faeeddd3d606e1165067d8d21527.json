Destroy it?  Live long enough to see it destroyed?  In this classic 1986 simulation by Mark C. Bayliss, you lead a nation against the world's market and dangerously ambitious nations in an attempt to survive the nuclear/biological holocaust(s)!\r\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to find this game (I spent a long, loooong time tracking it down), and it'd kill me if it faded into history.  Share it by seeding it as long as you can, please, or email it to a friend, heck, copy it to an old floppy to play on that old dinosaur you have plugged in in the spare room!  Just share it!
