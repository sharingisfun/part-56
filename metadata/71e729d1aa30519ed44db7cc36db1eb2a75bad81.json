Early in her career, she established her reputation as a member of the Fugees. In 1998, she launched her solo career with the release of the commercially successful and critically acclaimed album, The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill. The recording earned Hill five Grammy Awards, including the coveted album of the year and best new artist awards. \r\nFollowing the success of her debut album, Hill largely dropped out of public view, in part due to her displeasure with fame and the music industry. After a four-year hiatus, she released MTV Unplugged 2.0, a live recording of &quot;deeply personal songs&quot; performed mostly solo with an acoustic guitar. Today, she avoids publicity, and is the mother of five children with Rohan Marley, the fourth son of reggae musician Bob Marley.\r\n\r\n[b]Lauryn Hill â€Žâ€“ The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\r\nGenre:[/b] Hip Hop\r\n[b]Style:[/b] RnB/Swing, Conscious\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 1998\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
