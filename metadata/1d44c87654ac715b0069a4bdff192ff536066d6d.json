The story starts with an early SETI project, but quickly becomes a space battle of good vs. evil.\r\n\r\nAstronomer Joe Burke heads Project Star Talk, which uses a radio telescope to search the stars for communication from alien species. The project has so far failed to produce any results and the observatory head Henry Shore wants it shut down. Just then, they pick up a radio signal coming from the direction of the asteroid known as Schule's Object. Burke purchases equipment that can convert the telescope to broadcast a signal back to the source. Upon receiving it, the robot that maintains the base on the asteroid despatches a ship to Earth and snatches up the observatory. They are carried off back to the asteroid base.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 668x576, 25.000 fps, 2229 Kbps, 01h14m00s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/fieerb9lr/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5ezr1g8fp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bihblcyph/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/z86ra1x2t/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5vkynvw6t/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d44c87654ac715b0069a4bdff192ff536066d6d","amp;dn":"The+Terrornauts+%281967+-+United+Kingdom%29+outer+space+sci+fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d44c87654ac715b0069a4bdff192ff536066d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,68,200,118,84,172,113,91,0,105,164,189,255,25,47,245,54,6,109,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
