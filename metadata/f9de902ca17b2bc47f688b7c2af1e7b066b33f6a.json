We would like to thank you for taking interest in this project.\r\n\r\n'A Tribute To Sonata Arctica' will be a sensational tribute album, featuring cover versions of SONATA ARCTICA songs, performed by various artists from around the world who have been inspired by the Finnish power metallers' music.\r\n\r\nWe have been in discussion with SONATA ARCTICA regarding this unofficial release, and are proud to finally announce that the process of bringing this tribute album to their fans is underway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXANDRIA from Germany\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Don't Say A Word' from the album 'Reckoning Night' (2004)\r\n\r\n\r\nVAN CANTO from Germany\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Victoria's Secret' from the album 'Winterheart's Guild' (2003)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREAM OF PASSION from The Netherlands\r\nThe band are set to cover 'I Have A Right' from the album 'Stones Grow Her Name' (2012)\r\n\r\n\r\nARVEN from Germany\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Replica' from the album 'Ecliptica' (1999)\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSCORDIA from Belgium\r\nThe band are set to cover 'My Land' from the album 'Ecliptica' (1999)\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMELESS MIRACLE from Sweden\r\nThe band are set to cover 'FullMoon' from the album 'Ecliptica' (1999)\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNRISE from Ukraine\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Black Sheep' from the album 'Silence' (2001)\r\n\r\n\r\nINNVEIN from Argentina\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Wolf &amp; Raven' from the album 'Silence' (2001)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJESTY OF REVIVAL from Ukraine\r\nThe band are set to cover 'The Cage' from the album 'Winterheart's Guild' (2003)\r\n\r\n\r\nCELESTIAL WISH from England\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Paid In Full' from the album 'Unia' (2007)\r\n\r\nPLUS MANY MORE TBA!\r\n\r\n\r\nThese bonus tracks will feature cover songs of SONATA ARCTICA classics performed by Scottish artists signed to OUERGH RECORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORLICH from Scotland\r\nThe band are set to cover 'Respect The Wilderness' from the album 'Silence' (2001)\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSABLE from Scotland\r\nThe band are set to cover '8th Commandment' from the album 'Ecliptica' (1999)\r\n\r\nPLUS MANY MORE TBA!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this is an incredible release on a massive scale, we shall be able to bring 'A Tribute To Sonata Arctica' to the masses far more quickly with crowd-funding! Not only that, but we can also offer SONATA ARCTICA fans additional perks for aiding us along this journey.\r\n\r\nWith a funding goal of Â£5000 to continue with and complete the project, this amount will help allow us to ensure the album is mastered and printed to the highest possible quality.\r\n\r\nHowever, the more money we receive, the more well-known and professional acts we will be able to feature, making this album even greater than before.\r\n\r\nIn short, everything we make over Â£5000 will go towards BIGGER ARTISTS, COOLER ARTWORK, BETTER MASTERING and HIGHER QUALITY OVERALL for the final product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisques et dÃ©fis\r\n\r\nOnce we have been successfully funded, we shall begin to finalize all aspects of the album's release. \r\nPotential obstacles would include waiting for artwork, mixing/mastering of tracks, and the printing of CDs to be completed. However, this would only be a temporary wait, and 'A Tribute To Sonata Arctica' will be of higher quality due to it.\r\n\r\nOuergh Records is an established record label, and with a number of releases under our belt, those who pledge can expect nothing short of the highest of quality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9de902ca17b2bc47f688b7c2af1e7b066b33f6a","amp;dn":"VA+-+A+Tribute+To+Sonata+Arctica+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9de902ca17b2bc47f688b7c2af1e7b066b33f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,222,144,44,161,123,43,196,127,104,139,124,42,241,231,176,102,179,63,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
