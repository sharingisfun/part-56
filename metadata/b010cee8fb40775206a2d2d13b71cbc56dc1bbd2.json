Keeper of the Lost Cities (Keeper of The Lost Cities, #01) - Shannon Messenger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this riveting debut, a telepathic girl must figure out why she is the key to her brand-new worldâ€”before the wrong person finds the answer first.\r\n\r\nTwelve-year-old Sophie has never quite fit into her life. Sheâ€™s skipped multiple grades and doesnâ€™t really connect with the older kids at school, but sheâ€™s not comfortable with her family, either. And Sophie has a secretâ€”sheâ€™s a Telepath, someone who can read minds. But the day Sophie meets Fitz, a mysterious (and adorable) boy, she learns sheâ€™s not alone. Heâ€™s a Telepath too, and it turns out the reason she has never felt at home is that, wellâ€¦she isnâ€™t. Fitz opens Sophieâ€™s eyes to a shocking truth, and almost instantly she is forced to leave behind her family for a new life in a place that is vastly different from what she has ever known.\r\n\r\nBut Sophie still has secrets, and theyâ€™re buried deep in her memory for good reason: The answers are dangerous and in high-demand. What is her true identity, and why was she hidden among humans? The truth could mean life or deathâ€”and time is running out.\r\n\r\n02.

And it helps that living at Havenfield means getting to spend time with rare, precious species--including the first female Alicorn, who shows herself to Sophie and trusts no one but her.\r\n\r\nSophie is tasked with helping to train the magical creature so that the Alicorn can be revealed to the people of the lost cities as a sign of hope, and Sophie wants to believe that the recent drama and anguish is gone for good.\r\n\r\nBut the secrets buried deep in Sophie's memories remain, and before long she's back in incredible danger, risking everything to find the answers to questions that could save not only her life, but the life of someone close to her...\r\n\r\n03.

And the deeper Sophie searches, the farther the conspiracy stretches, proving that her most dangerous enemy might be closer than she realizes.\r\n\r\nIn this nail-biting third book in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series, Sophie must fight the flames of rebellion, before they destroy everyone and everything she loves.\r\n\r\n04.
