The story is about Stax Records whose hits include Sittin' On the Dock of the Bay, Soul Man, If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Wanna Be Right), Knock On Wood and Respect.\r\n A white brother and sister establish a recording studio in a black Memphis neighbourhood in the 1960s and their open-door policy created an interracial house band - Booker T. and the MGs - who made hits for whomever came through those doors. \r\n Those Stax stars included Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, The Dramatics, Albert King, Luther Ingram, Rufus Thomas and Jesse Jackson. The legacy has never been stronger and Stax songs have been recorded by scores of artists-- Aretha Franklin, Neil Young, Wu Tang Clan, Michael Bolton and almost every artist wanting to express their soul. \r\n Respect Yourself includes never before seen footage, including home movies by the Stax artists, outtakes from WattStax, lost performances by Otis Redding, Booker T. and the MGs, Isaac Hayes and others. \r\n Interviews include all the key players plus Jesse Jackson, Elvis Costello, Bono, Chuck D, Peter Townshend, Dan Aykroyd, Justin Timberlake.\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2 Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 4664 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd(0x80):48000Hz 256 kb/s tot.\r\nstereo (2/0)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017e2372c79ba39f31799080eee0ba2d5a3a33ba","amp;dn":"RespectYourself-TheStoryOfStax-BBCTV-DVD5-PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017e2372c79ba39f31799080eee0ba2d5a3a33ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,126,35,114,199,155,163,159,49,121,144,128,238,224,186,45,90,58,51,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
