Despite its 16C setting this is a republican protest against the ancien regime then dominating Europe. A similar impulse is expressed in the dungeon scene of Beethovenâ€™s Fidelio and in Goyaâ€™s â€˜3 de Mayoâ€™ - Go to - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Chillon, for the background to the poem.\r\n\r\nDespite his liberal prejudices, Byron had sufficient whiggish broadmindedness to appreciate the irony that when the crowd stormed the Bastille on July 14th they would liberate only four forgers, two lunatics and a â€˜deviantâ€™ committed by his family (and that a few days before, the Marquis de Sade had walked free)\r\n\r\nA pleasant, authoritative reading with certain donnish inflections. Note that a few words are pronounced as they would have been in the early 1800s. The sound is quite good though there is occasional tape echo.
