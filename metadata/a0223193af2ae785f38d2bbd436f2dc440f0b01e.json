Luckily, there are many specialized tools with this goal, such as HitmanPro. It is a powerful application that can detect and remove most Viruses that could come in contact with your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloud-Assisted Virus Remover\r\n\r\nRight off the bat you can notice a great thing about this utility, namely the fact that it uses a cloud engine when scanning, therefore several Anti-Malware engines are at work to help you find and obliterate any trace of malicious code.\r\n\r\n\r\nFind and remove threats easily\r\n\r\nAnother neat feature of Hitman Pro is the ability to run without installation when needed, so it can be used from a portable storage device. In case you wish to keep it on your system, through, select the option to create a copy of the utility, so you can regularly scan yopur computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe default scan takes a few minutes to complete and you can track the real-time progress and view on the spot any suspicious or dangerous items found in your system. Viruses or other types of computer infections can be either deleted, quarantined, ignored (not recommended) or reported as safe. A small description of each threat is displayed below the files in the list, as well as the level of risk it present.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation and conclusion\r\n\r\nDuring my test, Hitman Pro managed to find a lot of Tracking Cookies and a couple of suspicious executable files in the Temporary Internet Files folder, which were swiftly removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, this updated application of Hitman Pro looks and works very well. Even if it may not be suited as a first line of defence, Hitman Pro can surely prove a great addition that can work alongside a fully-fledged Anti-Virus solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges in 3.7.12 Build 253 (2015-11-03):\r\n\r\n- MPROVED: Remnant scanner. \r\n\r\n- IMPROVED: Compatible Disk Access mode. \r\n\r\n- IMPROVED: Scanning Windows Server environments. \r\n\r\n- IMPROVED: Quarantaine.xml formatting.\r\n\r\n- IMPROVED: Microsoft Edge Browser\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n \nhttp://imgbay.mobi/di/Knipsel-xffge.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0223193af2ae785f38d2bbd436f2dc440f0b01e","amp;dn":"HitmanPro+3.7.12+Build+253+%2B+Serial+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0223193af2ae785f38d2bbd436f2dc440f0b01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,34,49,147,175,42,231,133,243,141,43,189,67,111,45,196,64,240,176,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
