We draw the line. Maybe we even believe it.\r\n \r\nSage Hendricks was my line.\r\n \r\nLogan Witherspoon befriends Sage Hendricks at a time when he no longer trusts or believes in people. As time goes on, he finds himself drawn to Sage, pulled in by her deep, but sexy feminine voice and her constant smile. Eventually Loganâ€™s feelings for Sage grow so strong that he canâ€™t resist kissing her. Moments later, he wishes he never had. Sage finally discloses her big secret: she was born a boy. Enraged, frightened, and feeling betrayed, Logan lashes out at Sage. Once his anger has cooled, however, his regrets lead him to attempt to rekindle their friendship. But itâ€™s hard to replace something thatâ€™s been brokenâ€”and itâ€™s even harder to find your way back to friendship when you began with love.\r\n \r\n***\r\n \r\nâ€œTackles issues of homophobia, hate crimes and stereotyping with humor and grace in an accessible tone that will resonate with teens.â€ â€“Kirkus Reviews\r\n \r\nâ€œIt is Sage's story that is truly important.â€ â€“SLJ\r\n \r\nâ€œTeensâ€”both those familiar with transgender issues and those who are notâ€”will welcome the honest take on a rarely explored subject.â€ â€“Booklist\r\n \r\nâ€œA sensitive examination of the seldom treated subject of transgender teens.â€ â€“VOYA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f1cdb5734d9d5ba41e793544874f77bb520817","amp;dn":"Almost+Perfect+-+Brian+Katcher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f1cdb5734d9d5ba41e793544874f77bb520817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,241,205,181,115,77,157,91,164,30,121,53,68,135,79,119,187,82,8,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
