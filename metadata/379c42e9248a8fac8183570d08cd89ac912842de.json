Hosted by comedian Matthew Giffen, the judges of this fright-fest are a cinema audience - which has been rigged with cameras to capture every jump, scream and cry.\r\n\r\nIn the final episode, after the last remaining films are scored by the cinema audience, the fright-fest reaches a nail-biting climax. World-renowned director Eduardo Sanchez, of The Blair Witch Project, is called in to judge the top three highest scoring films as rated by the audience. We meet the final three film-makers, before Sanchez views the films himself and decides which one is worthy of winning the competition and Â£20,000 worth of support towards their next project - which will then be shown on a BBC platform","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:379c42e9248a8fac8183570d08cd89ac912842de","amp;dn":"The.Fear.%5B2015%5D.s01e06.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"379c42e9248a8fac8183570d08cd89ac912842de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,156,66,233,36,138,143,172,129,131,87,13,8,205,137,172,145,40,66,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
