The urban toughness melted into a jazzed up groove was a surefire hit ingredient in my books, especially on the cool as a cucumber 'Downtown' and monstrous 'Tormented World'. \r\nFar more hardening than the pop funk jazz of the Chili Peppers, Naked Truth lived up to their name and refused to give up the fight. The struggle resulting in this tough nut of a record that has the word 'soul' leaking from every pore.\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/14gRH8f.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. The Door    [3:35]\r\n02.
