GALAK-Z is\r\n a modern, A.I. and physics-driven open-world action game, viewed through\r\n the lens of the classic 16-bit space shooter. Powered by the\r\n next-generation Cyntient AI platform, GALAK-Z puts players in control of\r\n anime-inspired spacecraft inhabiting procedurally generated worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n In GALAK-Z both stealth and skill are required to defeat truly intelligent\r\n enemies. You will be forced to outsmart enemies that think, react and\r\n cooperate like seasoned pilots! Master your ship's sublimely-honed controls\r\n as you blast enemies, unleash missile salvos, and even toss your opponents,\r\n mech-style, to their explosive demise.\r\n\r\n\r\n New features include Arcade Mode which lets you replay failed missions any\r\n number of times without losing all of your saved progress. Rogue Mode\r\n retains GALAK-Z's original white-knuckle roguelike challenge that harkens\r\n back to the 16-bit era of gaming. Rogue mode will always be available if\r\n and when you're looking to test your skill and bravery by putting\r\n everything on the line, every mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n Players will be forced to outmaneuver, outgun and outsmart enemies that\r\n think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots. Both stealth and skill are\r\n required to defeat enemy squads in a brutal game of cat and mouse. Prepare\r\n for an enemy that comes alive like never before!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n * New ARCADE mode with per-Mission checkpoints!\r\n * Procedurally-assembled levels\r\n * Physics based combat simulator!\r\n * Advanced enemy A.I for intense dogfights!\r\n * Scripted missions and roguelite' structure\r\n * Resource-based, progressive weapons system\r\n * Inspired by 70s / 80s anime and arcade shooters\r\n\r\n\r\n            ÃŸ ÃœÃŸÃŸÃœ ÃœÃŸ   Â²ÃœÃœ  ÃœÃŸÃŸÃœ Â²   Â²   ÃœÃŸÃŸÃœ ÃœÃŸÃŸÃœ Â²ÃœÃœ  ÃœÃŸÃŸ  ÃœÃŸ\r\n ÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸ Ã› Ã›  Â² ÃŸÃŸÃŸÃ› Ã›  Ãœ Ã›ÃŸÃŸÂ² Ã›   Ã›   Ã›  Â² Ã›  Â² Ã›  Ãœ Â²ÃŸ Ãœ ÃŸÃŸÃŸÃ› ÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸ\r\n            ÃŸ ÃŸ     ÃŸÃŸ   ÃŸÃŸÃŸ ÃŸ    ÃŸÃŸÃŸ ÃŸÃŸÃŸ ÃŸ     ÃŸÃŸ   ÃŸÃŸÃŸ ÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸ  ÃŸÃŸ\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
