Faced with the unknown, he turns to primal scream therapy with his self-taught therapist Simon and retreats to the past, reminiscing with his old school pal Steve. A chance encounter with Cherie, a disillusioned actress who has returned home to reflect on her past and present to begin a more fulfilled life, leads Noel to open up and share his passions. Their shared love of music, eighties movies, and all things Christmas encourages a celebratory spirit, and the possibility of a Happy New Year. Will the insecurities of recent breakÂ­ups, seasonal intoxication, and misÂ­communication conspire to ruin their fun or will they simply have a Wonderful Christmas Time?\r\n\r\nDirector: Jamie Adams\r\nWriter: Jamie Adams\r\nStars: Laura Haddock, Holli Dempsey, Dylan Edwards \r\nGenres: Comedy\r\nCountry: UK\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: A.Wonderful.Christmas.Time.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                            \r\nSOURCE: 720p - Thanks friend!                                               \r\n\r\nViDEO: 2100 kbps XviD               \r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x400                           \r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h25m33sec      \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: N/A                               \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 192 Kbps AC3        \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight. \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PJf \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PK8 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PKa \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PKw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a1e6dedaf03ce12a2f015510c80418e5d3e427c","amp;dn":"A.Wonderful.Christmas.Time.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a1e6dedaf03ce12a2f015510c80418e5d3e427c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,30,109,237,175,3,206,18,162,240,21,81,12,128,65,142,93,62,66,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
