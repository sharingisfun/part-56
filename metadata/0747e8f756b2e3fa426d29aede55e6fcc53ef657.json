Meanwhile, the rural police deal with a cat stranded in a boat, the urban police aren't fooled by a bluffing burglar and the traffic cops encounter a dozy pedestrian and a sleeping salesman. Volunteer Officer Ken Beattie fines a litterbug on a bridge, Operator Maggie LeBeau tells us about her heroes, and Sergeant Karen Ann Millar is offered fingerprints and some glockenspiel music from local man Bobby Muir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0747e8f756b2e3fa426d29aede55e6fcc53ef657","amp;dn":"Scot.Squad.s02e01.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0747e8f756b2e3fa426d29aede55e6fcc53ef657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,71,232,247,86,178,227,250,66,109,41,174,222,85,230,252,197,62,246,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
