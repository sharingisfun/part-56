In each place, they face challenges for which they need to combine their own talents with local techniques to outwit the environment they find themselves in. The series explores the incredible world of fishing, looking at its variety of fish and their behaviour in distinct environments, and revealing surprising animals and stunning landscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  Zambia \r\nThe three finalists face their sixth country and their final frontier - Zambia. Navigating the immense Zambezi River, the anglers fish alongside wild animals on land and in the murky water. They search the croc-infested waters for huge vundu catfish, fish local style from wobbly dugout canoes and try to catch Africa's equivalent to the piranha - the tiger fish. They must use everything they have learnt across their worldwide expedition as the judges will be looking for which one of them is the complete angler. Matt Hayes will be joined by Charles Tembo, who has grown up on the banks of the Zambezi, whilst Ben Fogle will be with the anglers every step of the way on their final journey. The fish here have adapted to survive in these dangerous waters. The anglers have just one week to prove they have the courage - and the skills - to do the same.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CALVC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3001 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\nPart 5 has no Merged Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d9xfp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984f8dc6f02bcb0696409db96f272e91b490049a","amp;dn":"BBC+Earths+Wildest+Waters+The+Big+Fish+Series+1+6of6+Zambia+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984f8dc6f02bcb0696409db96f272e91b490049a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,79,141,198,240,43,203,6,150,64,157,185,111,39,46,145,180,144,4,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
