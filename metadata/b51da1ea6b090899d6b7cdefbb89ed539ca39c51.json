They are often cited as the first band to define the punk rock sound. Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the 1970s punk movement in both the United States and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAll of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname &quot;Ramone&quot;, although none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded. By 2014, all four of the band's original membersâ€”lead singer Joey Ramone (1951â€“2001), guitarist Johnny Ramone (1948â€“2004), bassist Dee Dee Ramone (1951â€“2002) and drummer Tommy Ramone (1949â€“2014)â€”had died.\r\n \r\n         Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only the Beatles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.09. PUNK ROCK  \r\n\r\n       Punk rock is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels. By late 1976, bands such as the Ramones, in New York City, and the Sex Pistols and The Clash, in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGLERS  - (Get A) Grip (On Yourself) (1977)\r\nSEX PISTOLS  -  God Save The Queen  (1977)\r\nTHE UNDERTONES - Teenage Kicks  (1978)\r\nTHE STRANGLERS  -  Nice N' Sleazy  (1978)\r\nRAMONES  -  Needles and Pins  (1978)\r\nCLASH  -  London Calling  (1979)\r\nRAMONES  -  Do You Remember Rock 'N' Roll Radio (1980)\r\nRAMONES  -  It's Not My Place, In The 9 To 5 World  (1981)\r\nCLASH  -  Should I Stay Or Should I Go  (1982)\r\nCLASH  -  Rock The Casbah (1982)\r\nRAMONES  -  Time Has Come Today (1983)\r\nRAMONES  -  Psycho Therapy (1983)\r\nRAMONES  -  Somebody Put Something In My Drink (1986)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51da1ea6b090899d6b7cdefbb89ed539ca39c51","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+594","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51da1ea6b090899d6b7cdefbb89ed539ca39c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,29,161,234,107,9,8,153,214,183,205,239,187,137,237,83,156,163,156,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
