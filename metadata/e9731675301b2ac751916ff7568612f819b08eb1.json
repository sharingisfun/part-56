Itâ€™s a muscle, and once you learn how to flex it, youâ€™ll be able to meet lifeâ€™s challenges and fulfill your goals, Bernard Roth, Academic Director at the Stanford d.school contends.\r\n\r\nIn The Achievement Habit, Roth applies the remarkable insights that stem from design thinkingâ€”previously used to solve large scale projectsâ€”to help us realize the power for positive change we all have within us. Roth leads us through a series of discussions, stories, recommendations, and exercises designed to help us create a different experience in our lives. He shares invaluable insights we can use to gain confidence to do what weâ€™ve always wanted and overcome obstacles that hamper us from reaching our potential, including:\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t tryâ€”DO;\r\nExcuses are self-defeating;\r\nBelieve you are a doer and achiever and youâ€™ll become one;\r\nBuild resiliency by reinforcing what you do rather than what you accomplish;\r\nLearn to ignore distractions that prevent you from achieving your goals;\r\nBecome open to learning from your own experience and from those around you;\r\nAnd more.\r\nThe brain is complex and is always working with our egos to sabotage our best intentions. But we can be mindful; we can create habits that make our lives better.
