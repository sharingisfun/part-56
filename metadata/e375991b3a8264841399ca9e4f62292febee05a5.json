That's right; contestants wore      |\n\t | dresses and suits in the very early months of LMAD.A few months|\n     | after the show's premiere, someone came with a sign to attract |\n\t | host Monty Hall's attention and low and behold, he chose her   |\n\t | (or him)! Sometime later,someone wore a crazy costume and the  |\n\t | entire studio changed from a formal, quiet,dignified setting to|\n     | a free-for-all. The show came alive and became the legendary   |\n\t | success it would be known for.                                 |\n\t |                                                                |\n     | Let's Make A Deal - 10/23/2015                                 |\n     | Costumed contestants including a marionette, a jelly           |\n     | sandwich, and a graduate play &quot;Three Card Tiffany&quot; and other   |\n     | great games for the chance to win cash and prizes!
