Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nThis is the unaired episode from Thursday. Hence the weird release date. (The Saturday episode is always a rerun.)\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders is raking in the donors. He's really hitting Hillary hard and Kennedy couldn't be happier.\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders is gaining traction against Clinton. What's sustaining this socialist groundswell? DAVE SMITH, JIMMY FAILLA, and KAYLEIGH McENANY discuss. Joe Biden has said he isn't going to include himself in the first debates. Hillary is still worried. She's started incorporating Joe snubs into her rhetoric. Only one Republican is slated for being in lower tier of the next Republican debates. Sadly it's Rand Paul. Will he debate himself?\r\n\r\nOLD SCHOOL vs NEW SCHOOL: DR. MARY ELLEN WEBER, nasa astronaut vs PETER SUDERMAN, reason magazine. Should space travel be public or private? \r\n\r\nThe panel returns to talk about an app that is basically Yelp for people. Stephen Hawking is afraid of an alien invasion. Hospitals in the united states are being required to adopt internationally developed standards called ICD10. They are codes that detail someones manner of death or injury. There are 70,000+ different codes detailing different things.\r\n\r\nSAMANTHA BROWN and CHRIS GRUNDY of 50/50 are here. They host a show where random people are approached on the street and offered 50 hours of adventure worth 50,000 dollars. The catch? You've got the leave right away.\r\n\r\nNightcap. Mailbag.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name : Kennedy.2015.10.03.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media\r\nCodec ID : isom\r\nFile size : 251 MiB\r\nDuration : 41mn 53s\r\nOverall bit rate : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration : 41mn 53s\r\nBit rate : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth : 624 pixels\r\nHeight : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Variable\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.106\r\nStream size : 210 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 41mn 53s\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 38.3 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d09cf0550773d24f092a336075bfe8877be1cde","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.10.03.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d09cf0550773d24f092a336075bfe8877be1cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,9,207,5,80,119,61,36,240,146,163,54,7,91,254,136,119,190,28,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
