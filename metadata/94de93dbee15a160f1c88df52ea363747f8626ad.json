In this book, Jackie seems to be much nicer to the Doctor then she is in the usual Ninth Doctor episodes. \r\n\r\nAbout The Author:\r\nJacqueline Rayner is a best selling British author, best known for her work with the licensed fiction based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Her first professional writing credit came when she adapted Paul Cornell's Virgin New Adventure novel Oh No It Isn't! for the audio format, the first release by Big Finish. (The novel featured the character of Bernice Summerfield and was part of a spin-off series from Doctor Who.) She went on to do five of the six Bernice Summerfield audio adaptations and further work for Big Finish before going to work for BBC Books on their Doctor Who lines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94de93dbee15a160f1c88df52ea363747f8626ad","amp;dn":"03+Winner+Takes+All+-+Doctor+Who+%28Jacqueline+Rayner%29+ZEO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94de93dbee15a160f1c88df52ea363747f8626ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,222,147,219,238,21,161,96,241,200,141,245,46,163,99,116,127,134,38,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
