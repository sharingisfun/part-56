After being mugged he is hanging out on a park bench when he meets Laney, a nice, sweet, brainwashed girl who tells him that she knows a place where he can stay. She also tells him that there is a doctor at this place who can help him with his headaches. Once this doctor performs surgery on Tristan his migraines go away and he starts to feel better. Unfortunately, it turns out that the doctor is quite out of his mind and is actually implanting devices into people's brains so he can control them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 716x480, 23.976 fps, 1471 Kbps, 01h32m55s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, MULTI Audio English with commentary tracks, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cfqwyoy6x/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/snn7az0sr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bd1dwoyiz/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jtwatvdu3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/hs0etd58r/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d08cece94f4ca2e49e6c6a31e5b9aca8a243230c","amp;dn":"Brainjacked+%282009+-+USA%29+science+fiction+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d08cece94f4ca2e49e6c6a31e5b9aca8a243230c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,140,236,233,79,76,162,228,158,108,106,49,229,185,172,168,162,67,35,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
