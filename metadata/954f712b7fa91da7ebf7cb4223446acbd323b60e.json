Grant Green plays guitar in a laidback quartet with Herbie Hancock on piano, Reggie Workman on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums â€“ all working wonderfully together, in long spiralling lines that are filled with soul and a gentle, easy groove. \r\n\r\nThe set is an odd mix of compositions with a &quot;western&quot; theme â€“ like &quot;I Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot;, and &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot; â€“ but the players more than manage to make the session swing way past the origins of the material! Very tough to find, but an essential addition to any Grant Green collection!\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - On Top Of Old Smokey\r\n02 - I Can't Stop Loving You\r\n03 - Wagon Wheels\r\n04 - Red River Valley\r\n05 - Tumbling Tumbleweeds\r\n\r\n*2004 Blue Note / Capitol / EMI | 7243 5 95962 2 8 {Blue Note RVG Remaster 2004}\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nGrant Green - guitar\r\nHerbie Hancock - piano\r\nReggie Workman - bass\r\nBilly Higgins - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:954f712b7fa91da7ebf7cb4223446acbd323b60e","amp;dn":"Grant+Green+-+Goin%27+West+%281962%29%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"954f712b7fa91da7ebf7cb4223446acbd323b60e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,79,113,43,127,169,29,167,235,247,203,66,35,68,106,203,211,35,182,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
