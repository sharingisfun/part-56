Years into the future, Captain Shaw408 discovers a book that contains an old photo of his dead father. Instead of incinerating it with the rest of the Christian propaganda that he and â€œThe Allianceâ€ are out to destroy, he keeps it, discovering that itâ€™s the diary of a college student named Roxy â€“ a girl in todayâ€™s time who seeks to document the dark truth behind a â€œterrorist attackâ€ that killed her fiancÃ©.\r\n\r\nAs Shaw reads her diary years later, he too sees the truth about the conspiracy that started the end of the world, realizing that he is on the wrong side. And while they both find the truth, will they be able to escape the lies without being killed?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf28caf380fe6d6956bdf7130e58992bd3526a40","amp;dn":"Rumors+of+Wars+-+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf28caf380fe6d6956bdf7130e58992bd3526a40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,40,202,243,128,254,109,105,86,189,247,19,14,88,153,43,211,82,106,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
