The new nation was deeply in debt and needed its economy to grow quickly, but its merchant ships were under attack. Pirates from North Africaâ€™s Barbary coast routinely captured American sailors and held them as slaves, demanding ransom and tribute payments far beyond what the new counÂ­try could afford.\r\n\r\nOver the previous fifteen years, as a diplomat and then as secretary of state, Jefferson had tried to work with the Barbary states (Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco). Unfortunately, he found it impossible to negotiate with people who believed their religion jusÂ­tified the plunder and enslavement of non-Muslims. These rogue states would show no mercyâ€”at least not while easy money could be made by extorting the Western powers. So President Jefferson decided to move beyond diplomacy. He sent the U.S. Navyâ€™s new warships and a detachment of Marines to blockade Tripoliâ€”launching the Barbary Wars and beginning Americaâ€™s journey toward future superpower status.\r\n\r\nAs they did in their previous bestseller, George Washingtonâ€™s Secret Six, Kilmeade and Yaeger have transformed a nearly forgotten slice of history into a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next. Among the many susÂ­penseful episodes:\r\n\r\nÂ·Lieutenant Andrew Sterettâ€™s ferocious cannon battle on the high seas against the treacherous pirate ship Tripoli.\r\n\r\nÂ·Lieutenant Stephen Decaturâ€™s daring night raid of an enemy harbor, with the aim of destroying an American ship that had fallen into the piratesâ€™ hands.\r\n\r\nÂ·General William Eatonâ€™s unprecedented five-hundred-mile land march from Egypt to the port of Derne, where the Marines launched a surprise attack and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.\r\n\r\nFew today remember these men and other heroes who inspired the Marine Corps hymn: â€œFrom the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli, we fight our countryâ€™s battles in the air, on land and sea.â€ Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates recaptures this forgotÂ­ten war that changed American history with a real-life drama of intrigue, bravery, and battle on the high seas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c061e7edca35d914fe894ff2d09f58b583f2b9c","amp;dn":"Thomas+Jefferson+and+the+Tripoli+Pirates+2015+%7B%7BERTB%7D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c061e7edca35d914fe894ff2d09f58b583f2b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,6,30,126,220,163,93,145,79,232,148,255,45,9,245,139,88,63,43,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
