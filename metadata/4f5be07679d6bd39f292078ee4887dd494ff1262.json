Despite his current vogue, Serge Gainsbourg may be a bit of an acquired taste for Americans, particularly if they don't have enough French to get his brilliant, sardonic lyrics. Personally, I think his early songs are generally his best stuff, and I would recommend starting here, on this remastered first album issued on the Mercury Records Vinyl Replica.\r\n\r\nNÂ° 2 is the second album by French musician Serge Gainsbourg, released in 1959. It features Gainsbourg backed by the Alain Goraguer Orchestra. The late Serge Gainsbourg made a name for himself fairly early in his recording career with his combination of French cabaret music, bordello jazz, and drunken musique exotica. \r\n\r\nHis second effort features Gainsbourg with a cigarette, appropriately seated at a worn desk littered with roses, a long-nosed 38 caliber placed squarely in front of him, and a quizzical, daring look on his puss that seems to say, &quot;Can't figure it out? Of course!&quot; Gainsbourg actually attempted singing in the early days, before his voice began to go and all he could do was whisper or rant his crazy poetry. \r\n\r\nHere he fronts the Alain Goraguer Orchestra on eight selections that are as typical of his oeuvre as Love on the Beat was nearly 30 years later. His topics are the seduction site of the jukebox on &quot;Le Claquer de Doights&quot; and a theme based on d'Alfred de Musset's &quot;Night Doctor.&quot; There are also a couple of Latin-styled numbers in &quot;Mambo Miam Miam&quot; and &quot;Indifferente,&quot; with a serious Stan Getz-aped sax solo in the middle eight (not to mention a crazy TV western theme as a cabaret song in &quot;Jeunes Femmes et Vieux Messieurs&quot;). \r\n\r\nThis is truly the beginning of Gainsbourg's hepcat legend, and musically, for all the kitsch and gimmick, it comes across as totally sincere in its campy chariot. This is why we dig French pop, and this is why Gainsbourg holds sway with everyone from Nick Cave to Angie Stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Le Poinponneur Des Lilas\r\n02 - La Recette De L'amour Fou\r\n03 - Douze Belles Dans La Peau\r\n04 - Ce Mortel Ennui\r\n05 - Ronsard '58\r\n06 - La Femme Des Uns Sous Le Corps Des Autres\r\n07 - L'alcool\r\n08 - Du Jazz Dans Le Ravin\r\n09 - Charleston Des Demenageurs De Piano\r\n10 - La Claqueur De Doigts\r\n11 - La Nuit D'octobre\r\n12 - Adieu Creature!\r\n13 - L'anthracite\r\n14 - Mambo Miam Miam\r\n15 - Indifferente\r\n16 - Jeunes Femmes Et Vieux Messieurs\r\n17 - L'amour A La Papa\r\n\r\n*2011 Mercury / Universal | 277 162-9 {Mercury Records - Vinyl Replica Reissue 2011 Set, CD 3of12}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Serge Gainsbourg Vinyl Replica...\r\n\r\n\r\nJane Birkin &amp; Serge Gainsbourg - Je T'aime...
