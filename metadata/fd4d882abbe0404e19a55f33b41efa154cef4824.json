The story then follows the life of Anakin Skywalker, a Padawan, as he learns the ways of the Jedi, as he and his allies (Obi-Wan, Senator Amidala, Yoda, Mace Windu, R2-D2, and C-3PO), attempt to stop corruption in the Senate, all the while keeping his love with Senator Amidala a secret. The conclusion is cluminated with Order 66, phantom Sith rising, and the birth of twins, the Galactice Empire, and Lord Darth Vader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4d882abbe0404e19a55f33b41efa154cef4824","amp;dn":"A+Phantom+Sith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd4d882abbe0404e19a55f33b41efa154cef4824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,77,136,42,187,224,64,78,25,165,95,51,180,30,250,21,76,239,72,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
