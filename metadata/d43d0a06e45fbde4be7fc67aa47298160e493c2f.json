Claxton, who died just before the album was released, contributes four originals to this 11-track set, and his songs and delivery are as solid as anything on the honky-tonk scene today. Always in the running for top vocalist at the annual Austin Music Awards, Claxton leans into his work as hard as anyone, and his backwoods George Jones squeal (think Jones in â€œWhite Lightninâ€™â€ mode) is nothing but legit. Period. Whether itâ€™s a stone-killer drinking song like â€œYou Can Set Your Watch By Meâ€ (â€œthe sign says happy hour /but it wonâ€™t make me smile/no, happy hour always leaves me feelinâ€™ blueâ€) or the danger-in-the-curves rockabilly treatment of the title track, where he sings that in 10 years and a million miles heâ€™s gone through â€œtwo pairs of boots and five hairstyles,â€ Claxton sounds perfectly in his element. With Austin all-star aces Kevin Smith (Derailers, Ronnie Dawson) on bass and veteran drummer Tom Lewis (Jim Lauderdale, Wagoneers, Heybale) laying in hypnotic shuffle beats with multi-instrumental badass Erik Hokkanen on lead guitar and fiddle, Ten Years and a Million Miles sounds like what happened when hard-scrabble hillbillies like Faron Young and Lefty Frizzell hit Nashville and turned it upside down. George Strait and Tim McGraw could stand to spend some quality time with Flat Top Jones. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43d0a06e45fbde4be7fc67aa47298160e493c2f","amp;dn":"Flat+Top+Jones+-+Ten+Years+and+a+Million+Miles+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43d0a06e45fbde4be7fc67aa47298160e493c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,61,10,6,228,95,189,228,190,127,198,122,164,114,152,22,14,73,60,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
