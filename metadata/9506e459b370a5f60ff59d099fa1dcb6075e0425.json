PROTECTION: Steam\r\n1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: Action, Indie, RPG\r\n\r\nWave of Darkness invites you to a huge dark and gritty fantasy world which\r\ncan be explored the way you want and whenever you want. Tired of killing\r\nmonsters and solving quests on the east? You can go north and explore the\r\nregion of Klesabia, Macabon or Ealonia, slay northern monsters\r\ngenerally do whatever you desire\r\n\r\nWave of Darkness is not your average casual action RPG. It is tailored for\r\nfans of hardcore old-school RPG titles, offering massive dark and gritty\r\nfantasy world which will challenge you at every step. The world of Narr is\r\ncorrupted by the Dark Magic, and you will have to do your best to free land\r\nfrom this malicious deviance\r\n\r\nWhile most RPG titles offer very limited area for you to explore\r\nrestricting it by invisible walls, or simply with various design solutions\r\nWave of Darkness enables you to wander everywhere, and whenever you wish to\r\ndo so. Of course, you can follow the strict path of the plot, and complete\r\nquests until you finish the game, or you can explore every bit and corner\r\nof Narr, meet various NPCs, complete side quests for them, and fight\r\ndangerous monsters. WOD offers 70+ hours of gameplay\r\n\r\nSo you decided to start the game by creating a sword wielding character\r\nbut after a while you realize swords aren't really your thing. Wave of\r\nDarkness enables you to combine and experiment different character classes\r\nwhich means you can have a powerful melee/ranged or ranged/magic character\r\neven if you made a mistake by choosing a character class that doesn't fit\r\nyour RPG affinities, without the need to start the game all over again. WoD\r\nenables you to combine, explore and experiment with character classes\r\nhowever you want, without limitations. But it's still recommended to keep\r\nin mind the basics of RPG, so try to create solid and meaningful characters\r\nbecause the game will definitely challenge you\r\n\r\n1. Unrar\r\n2.
