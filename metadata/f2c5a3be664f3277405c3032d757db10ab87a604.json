In May 1994, drummer and vocalist Johan Ericson, bassist and vocalist Jesper Stolpe and guitarist Andy HindenÃ¤s assembled the band Kerberos, initially playing melodic death metal with black metal influences. Seven months later, lead vocalist and lyrics composer Anders Jacobsson joined the band, and its name changed to Draconian.\r\n         Their first demo, Shades of a Lost Moon, was recorded in 1995. The demo counted with flutist and vocalist Jessica Eriksson, keyboardist and vocalist Susanne Arvidsson and with a special participation of Andreas Haag on the introductory section of â€œMy Nemesisâ€. It was released in February, 1996, however, no recording contract was obtained. In early 1997, the band proceeded to record their second demo, entitled In Glorious Victory. The band, however, became discontent with the quality of the recording and discontinued the release.\r\n\r\nGenre:\tDoom\r\n\r\nSubgenre: Doom Gothic\r\n\r\nBitrate: 320k\r\n\r\nSize:\t145.63 MB\r\n\r\n10 files\r\n\r\nTrack list:\r\n\r\n1.
