It prints plainly ludicrous stories, such as a double-decker London bus being found frozen in the Antarctic ice, or a World War II bomber found on the moon. Defenders of the paper pointed out that it was not intended to be taken seriously. Its controversial content also includes a high quotient of softcore female nudity and extensive advertising for sexual services.\r\n\r\nSunday Sport â€“ 13 December 2015-P2P\r\nEnglish | PDF | 64 pages | 70,81 MB\r\n \nhttp://s20.postimg.org/ek1rhfw0t/Zm_Z52_TN.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f45b3181a19ac443caa05d10a96d6425fbfa6d5","amp;dn":"Sunday+Sport+%26ndash%3B+13+December","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f45b3181a19ac443caa05d10a96d6425fbfa6d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,69,179,24,26,25,172,68,60,170,5,209,10,150,214,66,95,191,166,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
