Comedy from Chris Ramsey, Romesh Ranganathan and Matt Forde who provides a political round-up of the year. Plus the cast of Olivier Award 2015 winners The Play That Goes Wrong who will be joined by some surprise star cameos and the Queen of British soul Beverly Knight performs a number from the record breaking musical Cats.    \r\n \r\nJack said: â€œIt's a tremendous honour to be hosting the Royal Variety Performance. Having been lucky enough to perform for Prince Charles and Prince William in previous years I look forward to the opportunity of sailing a little too close to the wind in the presence of Prince Harry this time round. It's my third time on the show and I still am yet to perform in front of the Queen, she must be really desperate not to see my act.â€\r\n \r\nThe show promises to be an unforgettable evening of the best UK and international musical performers, extraordinary theatre, and brilliant comedy as well as a number of sensational surprises.\r\n \r\nThe event is staged in aid of the Royal Variety Charity (formerly the Entertainment Artistesâ€™ Benevolent Fund), whose patron is Her Majesty The Queen. The money raised from the show helps those people from the world of entertainment in need of care and assistance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd7c47b3fd9fce4b8036c47deb397e0834d22ca","amp;dn":"The.Royal.Variety.Performance.2015.ENSUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecd7c47b3fd9fce4b8036c47deb397e0834d22ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,215,196,123,63,217,252,228,184,3,108,71,222,179,151,224,131,77,34,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
