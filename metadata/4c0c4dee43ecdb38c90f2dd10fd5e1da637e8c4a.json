Eagles Of Death Metal, at whose concert 89 people were killed in one of the attacks, joined U2 to cover People Have The Power. U2 then handed over the stage to them and they performed their song I Love You All The Time to end the show. Since we only include songs featuring at least one member of U2, it does not appear in the above setlist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c0c4dee43ecdb38c90f2dd10fd5e1da637e8c4a","amp;dn":"U2+-+HBO+-+LEAKED+-+PARIS+07.12.2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c0c4dee43ecdb38c90f2dd10fd5e1da637e8c4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,12,77,238,67,236,219,56,201,15,45,209,15,213,225,218,99,126,140,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
