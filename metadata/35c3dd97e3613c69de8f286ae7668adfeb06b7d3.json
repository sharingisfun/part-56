Adding modeling to the design process makes it possible not only to predict flow patterns more accurately, and also to determine distorting effects on rotors and casing of pressure and temperature distribution within the compressor. Examples outline the scope of the applied mathematical model","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c3dd97e3613c69de8f286ae7668adfeb06b7d3","amp;dn":"Screw+Compressors+-+Three+Dimensional+Computational+Fluid+Dynami","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c3dd97e3613c69de8f286ae7668adfeb06b7d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,195,221,151,227,97,60,105,222,143,40,106,231,102,138,223,235,6,183,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
