New songs from Granger Smith, A Thousand Horses, Dierks Bentley and the Zac Brown Band round out our Top 30 U.S. Country hits this week.  The chart is powered by Mediabase, which I believe reflects the actual popularity of a song better than Billboardâ€™s rankings â€“ here they are in mp3 320 constant bit rate.\r\n\r\n01 Luke Bryan - Strip It Down (3:51)\r\n02 Old Dominion - Break Up With Him (3:21)\r\n03 Florida-Georgia Line - Anything Goes (3:32)\r\n04 Cole Swindell - Let Me See Ya Girl (3:02)\r\n05 Carrie Underwood - Smoke Break (3:14)\r\n06 Dan + Shay - Nothin' Like You (3:01)\r\n07 Chris Young - I'm Comin' Over (3:13)\r\n08 Blake Shelton - Gonna (3:00)\r\n09 Chase Rice - Gonna Wanna Tonight (3:32)\r\n10 Jason Aldean - Gonna Know We Were Here (3:36)\r\n11 Brett Eldredge - Lose My Mind (2:34)\r\n12 Cam - Burning House (3:45)\r\n13 Tim McGraw - Top Of The World (3:22)\r\n14 Brothers Osborne - Stay A Little Longer (5:32)\r\n15 Big &amp; Rich - Run Away With You (3:40)\r\n16 Parmalee - Already Callin' You Mine (2:59)\r\n17 Kelsea Ballerini - Dibs (2:58)\r\n18 Jana Kramer - I Got The Boy (3:17)\r\n19 Locash - I Love This Life (3:26)\r\n20 Randy Houser - We Went (2:53)\r\n21 Thomas Rhett - Die A Happy Man (3:43)\r\n22 Brad Paisley - Country Nation (3:38)\r\n23 Sam Hunt - Break Up In A Small Town (3:45)\r\n24 Hunter Hayes - 21 (3:11)\r\n25 Granger Smith - Backroad Song (3:46)\r\n26 Chase Bryant - Little Bit Of You (3:00)\r\n27 A Thousand Horses - (This Ainâ€™t No) Drunk Dial (3:26)\r\n28 Lee Brice - That Don't Sound Like You (edit) (3:15)\r\n29 Dierks Bentley - Riser (4:02)\r\n30 Zac Brown Band - Beautiful Drug (2:58)\r\n\r\nRECURRENT Kenny Chesney - Save It For A Rainy Day (2:59)\r\nRECURRENT Maddie &amp; Tae - Fly (3:33)\r\nRECURRENT Keith Urban - John Cougar, John Deere, John 3-16 (3:33)\r\n\r\nHope to see you again in November for another Top 30 U.S. Country torrent.
