They want each potter to make an original twelve-piece tea set out of porcelain, a true test of a potter's skills. The teapot is the toughest item to make, with a body, spout and lid, while the white and delicate porcelain is known as the trickiest of all clays to work with.\r\n\r\nThe other tests don't get much easier. They face a spot test from hell when they must cut intricate and decorative designs into leather-hard porcelain vases using a technique known as 'the devil's work'. For the final throw down, they have just 20 minutes to make three high-shouldered jugs - one of the hardest shapes to throw at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 08-Dec-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ce96e2074d55e789308f797994f04a27f26fc0","amp;dn":"The+Great+Pottery+Throw+Down+S01E06+Grand+Final+540p.HDTV.x264-J","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ce96e2074d55e789308f797994f04a27f26fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,206,150,226,7,77,85,231,137,48,143,121,121,148,240,74,39,242,111,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
