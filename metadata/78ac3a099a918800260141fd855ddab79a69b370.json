Haza came out of her '80s folk-fan circuit and returned to her beloved Israeli disco-pop with this highly produced set of songs that were clearly designed for the mainstream. She's got an incredible set of pipes, and they are readily in evidence here. Haza is a charmer when she sings, soaring above even the most trivial studio dubs and musical overloads that exemplify the backing tracks. There are more traditional recordings available from Haza, both predating and following this one, that accent her Israeli and Yemenite heritage. Desert Wind is for those looking for a heavier beat, a harder pop edge, and exotic samples rather than deeper roots. --Louis Gibson\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease seed this gem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n1\r\nWish Me Luck\r\n4:10\t\t\r\n3\t\r\nMiddle East\r\n4:38\t\t\r\n \r\n4\t\r\nI Want To Fly\r\n4:29\t\t\r\n \r\n5\t\r\nSlave Dream\r\n4:45\t\t\r\n7\t\r\nMm'mma (My Brothers Are There)\r\n9\t\r\nFatamorgana (Mirage)\r\n5:01\t\t\r\n\r\n \r\n10\t\r\nDa'aSa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78ac3a099a918800260141fd855ddab79a69b370","amp;dn":"Desert+Wind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78ac3a099a918800260141fd855ddab79a69b370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,172,58,9,154,145,136,0,38,1,65,253,133,93,218,183,154,105,179,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
