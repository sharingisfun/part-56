Written and produced by frontman Kelly Jones, it was used as the opening theme of the movie Wicker Park (2004) and was played during the credits at the end of the Academy Award-winning movie Crash (2004). It has more of a jazz ambience than some of their other songs; this and the whole album were considered a departure from the classic rock sound of previous album Just Enough Education to Perform. This song reached the band's second highest chart position to date, peaking at #3 on the UK Singles Chart in July 2003.    Jones typically plays the song alone on stage when performing live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78504a888a67a709ddac90572cebed774d7b02d2","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+592","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78504a888a67a709ddac90572cebed774d7b02d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,80,74,136,138,103,167,9,221,172,144,87,44,235,237,119,77,123,2,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
