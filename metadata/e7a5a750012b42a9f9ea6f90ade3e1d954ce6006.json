After a 2 and a half year period of downtime for other projects and lineup changes, Black Mass are officially back. \r\nThis album hearkens back to the glory days of thrash, with hints of Slayer, Destruction, Venom, Sepultura &amp; Metallica mixed with their own unique sounds. The 2 consistent members, Brendan O'Hare (vocals &amp; guitars) &amp; Cristiano Azevedo (bass) decided to record this album completely in analog format to give the impression that this wasn't something that took a week to record &amp; a few nights of ProTools magic to accomplish. \r\nEverything here was played live, completely recorded, mixed &amp; mastered to 2&quot; analog tape. While they have not immediately decided on a live drummer for upcoming fall &amp; winter shows, Dan Hammer (formerly of Sonic Pulse &amp; Skull Hammer) joined them for the recording of this album.\r\n\r\nALBUM : Ancient Scriptures\r\n\r\nYEAR: 2015\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY: USA\r\n\r\nSTYLE: Thrash Metal\r\n\r\nDURATION:\t00:39:42\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n\r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps \r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01.
