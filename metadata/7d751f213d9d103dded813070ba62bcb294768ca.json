He even tries making a few of his own.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nGeorge begins by meeting a father and son building an ambitious clifftop retreat and a young architect embarking on his first commission - a garden pavilion for his Gran. Master craftsman Will Hardie sets out to transform the humble beach hut into the most unlikely of holiday getaways, and in Germany, George visits a modern house in a medieval town.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nGeorge meets a man building a campervan out of CDs and old vinyl records. There's also a single dad making a home on the water for him and his sons out of an oil rig escape pod.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nGeorge meets a young man looking on an internet dating site for a shipmate to help turn an old boat into a home. There's also a cricket-mad granddad building a mini pavilion in his garden.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nGeorge meets a man planning to build Margate's first Victorian bathing machine in more than 100 years, and a coma survivor who proves he has a sense of humour by transforming a hearse into a family camper van. The presenter also visits a woman who has turned her narrowboat home into a floating bookshop, and in Germany he sees a lifeguard tower straight out of a 1950s sci-fi comic.\n\n5)  Part 5 \nGeorge visits a river barge conversion, an ingenious swimming pool restoration and a futuristic lakeside house in Germany\n\n6)  Part 6 \nGeorge meets a couple transforming their garden air-raid shelters. There's also 12-year-old Guinnie, who hopes to create the ultimate party shed, and some luxury beach houses.\n\n7)  Part 7 \nGeorge meets a couple so desperate to get on the housing ladder that they're making their own home out of scrap. And there's drama in the workshop with the beach hut project.\n\n8)  Part 8 \nGeorge and Will's floating beach hut goes to sea. There's also a festival campervan made from an American school bus and a family home in Germany built in an old grain silo.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Amazing-Spaces-Series-5-Screen15.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \n * Video Bitrate: 3145 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 47mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.03 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/spv8k/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d751f213d9d103dded813070ba62bcb294768ca","amp;dn":"George+Clarkes+Amazing+Spaces+Series+5+3of8+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d751f213d9d103dded813070ba62bcb294768ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,117,31,33,61,157,16,61,222,216,19,7,11,166,43,203,41,71,104,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
