It contains twelve tracks. \r\nIt was written and recorded directly after the boys were done with touring the first album and apart from a bigger production it's much in the same vein as Deaf Dumb Blind in terms of the musical direction, the lyrical topics, the song structures and the arrangements. \r\nThree bonus tracks were added to the 2004 re-release. Three singles and their accompanying videos were released from the album. (clawfinger.net)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/4VxK62K.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Power    [3:13]\r\n02. Pay The Bill    [4:20]\r\n03.
