They immerse themselves in the careers of megastars including George Formby and Gracie Fields, who both remain household names today. They also get to grips with some lesser-known artists, including La Loie Fuller, an innovative Chicago-born choreographer and dancer who took London by storm during the Edwardian era.\r\n\r\nTwo other stars of the pre-World War 1 era - the Scottish comedian and singer Sir Harry Lauder and the once hugely-famous Vesta Tilley, a talented male impersonator - feature prominently as well, and it's their acts that Frank and Suzy attempt to recreate, live on stage, at the end of the show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef34dabeb7b787cc05dd451940a0af2d81a34299","amp;dn":"What.A.Performance.Pioneers.of.Popular.Entertainment.s01e02.x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef34dabeb7b787cc05dd451940a0af2d81a34299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,52,218,190,183,183,135,204,5,221,69,25,64,160,175,45,129,163,66,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
