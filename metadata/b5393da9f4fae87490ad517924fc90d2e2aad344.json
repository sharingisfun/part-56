Their 2009 album Tales from the Grave in Space was one of the first albums ever released as a completely free download while signed to a record label.\r\n\r\nSchool friends Joe McGuigan (bass guitar) and Philly Byrne (vocals) formed Gama Bomb with the guitarist Luke Graham in Newry in 2002 and soon built up a small but loyal following which they consolidated with a rigorous touring schedule and frequent forays into self-released recording. The band first gained attention with their demo &quot;The Survival Option&quot; in the same year. In 2003, they toured and released &quot;The Fatal Mission&quot; single. During this period Byrne often appeared on stage in fancy dress as a chef, priest, pirate or scientist in an increasingly colourful stage show which frequently included a thrash metal version of the theme tune from the 1980s TV show Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Gama Bomb's first tour dates outside Ireland were in 2004, supporting the punk band The Dangerfields on a tour of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUntouchable Glory\r\n\r\nFull-lenght released in 2015.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
