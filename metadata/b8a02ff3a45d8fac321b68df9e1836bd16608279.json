It is the second version,\r\nfeaturing more electric guitar and a few other tweaks.\r\n\r\nIt is NOT an upmix of any stereo release.\r\n\r\nThis surround mix attempts to come close to the popular stereo mix,\r\nbut with lots of instrument separation, a fuller dynamic range.\r\nIt also includes a few overdubs that were mixed out of the stereo\r\nrelease, and does not fade at the end.\r\n\r\nThree file formats are included: FLAC, MKV, and DTS-WAV.\r\nFLAC: This is the best quality format of this release.\r\nMKV: This has DTS-MA audio, rate converted from 44.1kHz to 48kHz.\r\nDTS-WAV: This has the lowest quality. It will sound like noise if\r\nyour system isn't set-up for DTS.\r\n\r\n=====================================================================\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1.) The stems only contained two tracks of drums, probably from the\r\n    stereo overhead mics. Without discrete mics on the snare and hi-\r\n    hat, those instruments are weak in this mix.\r\n2.) Minimal effects were added to the raw tracks:\r\n    a.) The vocals were given modest reverb (much less than on the\r\n    popular stereo mix)\r\n    b.) The drum EQ was brightened to make up for the lack of\r\n    discrete snare and hi-hat tracks.\r\n3.) The song does not fade out like the stereo mix, but breaks down\r\n    as it did during recording.\r\n4.) No vocal parts are suppressed, even some ad libs that were not\r\n    in the stereo mix.\r\n5.) Only a few guitar parts are suppressed: Page tuning up during the\r\n    first verse, and then goofing with random feedback during the\r\n    second verse. Especially listen for a guitar fill that was not in\r\n    the stereo mix, emerging after the solo at 2:04, and panning from\r\n    the left rear to the right rear.\r\n6.) The LFE channel is unused, as subwoofer crossover choices are\r\n    best made by the playback system.\r\n=====================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a02ff3a45d8fac321b68df9e1836bd16608279","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Ramble+On+-+1969+-+5.1+Real+Remix+Phase+II+McB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a02ff3a45d8fac321b68df9e1836bd16608279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,160,47,243,164,93,143,172,50,27,104,223,158,24,54,189,22,96,130,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
