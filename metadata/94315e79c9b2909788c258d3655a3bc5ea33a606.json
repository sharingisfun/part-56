Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Rick Shapiro, Mike Ward, Rob Bartlett\r\n\r\nEpisode 271: Itâ€™s a packed house today with Rick Shapiro, Mike Ward, and Rob Bartlett talking to Ant about the big TACSgiving show, adjusting your lifestyle to work hours, fucking up casinos, Frankie Avalon, crossing borders, and the insanity of the news. They discuss free thinking, a NRA themed restaurant, Opie being terrorized via text, behind the scenes drama with the O&amp;A show, whispers, and we hear a â€œnot crazyâ€ story from Rick. The guys talk about quiet right's, NY versus LA, hack comics, Rick admits he doesnâ€™t listen to radio and gives us a glimpse into his brain, we see a theatrical performance by Rob, learn about Elliot Gouldâ€™s cock, and they commiserate about â€œthe end of the day.â€ Rick talks about his traveling schedule, his marriage, Colin Quinn, and being intense, they then get into being judged, Hitler and dead Jews, Bill Paxton movies, Titanic, Friday the 13th, making up words, Rob asks for a Rick translator, and Rick tries to explain himselfâ€¦and a robot. They discuss the homeless, Gere and his gerbil, gerbil ass play, Peter O'Toole, turkey cooking styles, boiler rooms, Americaâ€™s hat and underwear, the Mexican Deadliest Catch, Trump and Mitt Romney (from 4 years ago), outsourcing products, and Mike shares a wild drinking story. The guys call out movie fighting, a three way with Carly Simon, gerbil AIDS, Jackie Gleason and his fuck train, they rant about paying for train rides, train workers, and train passengers, and they wrap the day talking about â€œCelebrity Dick Swap,â€ the â€œGoGirl,â€ things that are important to men, Star Wars predictions, and Star Wars Scarface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94315e79c9b2909788c258d3655a3bc5ea33a606","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-11-24+Rick+Shapiro+Mike+Ward+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94315e79c9b2909788c258d3655a3bc5ea33a606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,49,94,121,201,178,144,151,136,194,88,211,101,90,59,197,234,51,166,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
