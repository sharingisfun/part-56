Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nâ€œAnthony Fails Tranny Testâ€\r\n\r\nEpisode 268: TACS starts with Ant singing the praises of yesterdayâ€™s smoking show with Attell, talking about train dangers and safety, Obamaâ€™s safety plans, a soda can that brought down a plane, extra presence of law enforcement, what it takes to wipe out a subway, false hopes of protection, and â€œBaby Face Finster.â€ We see the news story on a female suicide bomber, talk about Obamaâ€™s bad timing, KtC tells a story about having proper documentation, Ant rants on refugees, adhering to rules, Whoopi Goldberg, equating religion and law, the history of refugees, Ted Dansonâ€™s dickâ€™s history, and Anthony basically jerks off on the TV show Fargo. We take a look at hot Syrians, discuss asshole Hillary Clinton, watch an â€œequality commercialâ€ and one for â€œMoschino Barbie,â€ hear from callers about â€œsafe spaces,â€ Dave Attell, misconceptions at gun shows, and missing bits with Jimmy, and Ant also reads an â€œoffensiveâ€ Walmart article, and talks about annoying vegans. He then gets into cruise ship crime scenes, gay cruises, cats and cucumbers, being unarmed during a home invasion, gun safety and protection, transgender periods, and (unsuccessfully) plays a â€œspottingâ€ game.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:534612a0639a4d8ae6a1f4b70955cf411c886251","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-11-18+Anthony+Fails+Tranny+Test+MP4+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"534612a0639a4d8ae6a1f4b70955cf411c886251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,70,18,160,99,154,77,138,230,161,244,183,9,85,207,65,28,136,98,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
