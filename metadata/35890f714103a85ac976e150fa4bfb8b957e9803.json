But those images are much less straightforward than they may seem to a layperson: each one is the result of a complicated set of decisions and processes involving the large team behind the Rovers.\r\n\r\nWith Seeing Like a Rover, Janet Vertesi takes us behind the scenes to reveal the work that goes into creating our knowledge of Mars. Every photograph that the Rovers take, she shows, must be processed, manipulated, and interpretedâ€”and all that comes after team members negotiate with each other about what they should even be taking photographs of in the first place. Vertesiâ€™s account of the inspiringly successful Rover project reveals science in action, a world where digital processing uncovers scientific truths, where images are used to craft consensus, and where team members develop an uncanny intimacy with the sensory apparatus of a robot that is millions of miles away. Ultimately, Vertesi shows, every image taken by the Mars Rovers is not merely a picture of Marsâ€”itâ€™s a portrait of the whole Rover team, as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35890f714103a85ac976e150fa4bfb8b957e9803","amp;dn":"Seeing+Like+a+Rover+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35890f714103a85ac976e150fa4bfb8b957e9803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,137,15,113,65,3,168,90,201,118,225,80,250,75,251,139,149,126,152,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
