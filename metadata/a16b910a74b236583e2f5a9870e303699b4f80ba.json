Unfortunately, this simplified approach from Microsoft means much more data is passed onto them than many users would like.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft uses most data to display personalized information to you that is aimed at making your computer life easier. As an example, Windows 10 can remind you to set off to the airport 30 minutes earlier due to traffic en route. In order to deliver this information to you, however, Windows 10 has to access your calendar entries, your mails (i.e. the airline confirmation email), your location and it has to have access to the internet to get traffic news.\r\n\r\nSome services protocol your entire keyboard entries, share your WLAN access data with yourcontacts or connect your computer without asking permission to a public â€“ and potentially unprotected â€“ network. While this means that you and your contacts do not have to grapple with complicated WLAN passwords, it also poses a significant security risk.\r\n\r\nDecide for yourself how important your â€œcomfortâ€ is when weighed up with your privacy and how to protect it. O&amp;O ShutUp10 presents you with all important settings in one location â€“ you need no previous IT knowledge and there is no need to manually change the Windows 10 system settings. \r\n\r\nMore control over your operating system\r\n\r\n- Adapt your security settings\r\n- Protect your privacy\r\n- Control location services\r\n- Control Windows Updates\r\n- Do not pass on your user data and diagnostics\r\n\r\nFurther information\r\n\r\nPortable Version â€“ no installation required\r\nOperating System: MicrosoftÂ® Windows 10\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 1.3.1355\r\n\r\n- Option to deactivate the Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI)\r\n- Option to deactivate WiFi Sense for current and/or all users\r\n- SmartScreen Filter settings adapted and description corrected\r\n- Various grammatical errors in the english version corrected\r\n- Executable file modified\r\n- Small bug fixes\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16b910a74b236583e2f5a9870e303699b4f80ba","amp;dn":"O%26amp%3BO+ShutUp10+v1.3.1355+%28Portable+Windows+10+Privacy+Manager%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16b910a74b236583e2f5a9870e303699b4f80ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,107,145,10,116,178,54,88,62,47,90,152,112,227,3,105,155,79,128,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
