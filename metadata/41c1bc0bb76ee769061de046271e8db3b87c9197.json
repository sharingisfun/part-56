On his way he takes a fishing trip and learns how fishing in the deep blue waters runs a close run second to farming on this island. He then visits the bustling capital city of Cagliari, where he is introduced to the unique textures that the locals use to enhance their fish dishes. After a whistle stop shop at Europeâ€™s largest covered market, he makes his way to the magical ancient site of Nora, where he cooks a succulent tuna dish, as the sun sets over the ruins.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/12/02/9af09e9c811cba6d9479e4ba8029921f.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c1bc0bb76ee769061de046271e8db3b87c9197","amp;dn":"Ginos.Italian.Escape.s03e03.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41c1bc0bb76ee769061de046271e8db3b87c9197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,193,188,11,183,110,231,105,6,29,224,70,39,30,141,179,184,124,145,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
