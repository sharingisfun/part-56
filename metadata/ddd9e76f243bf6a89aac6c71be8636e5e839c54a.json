If youâ€™d like to build an electronic device, but donâ€™t have much experience with electronics components, this hands-on workbench reference helps you find answers to technical questions quickly.\r\n\r\nFilling the gap between a beginnerâ€™s primer and a formal textbook, Practical Electronics explores aspects of electronic components, techniques, and tools that you would typically learn on the job and from years of experience. Even if youâ€™ve worked with electronics or have a background in electronics theory, youâ€™re bound to find important information that you may not have encountered before.\r\n\r\nAmong the bookâ€™s many topics, youâ€™ll discover how to:\r\n\r\nRead and understand the datasheet for an electronic component\r\nUse uncommon but inexpensive tools to achieve more professional-looking results\r\nSelect the appropriate analog and digital ICs for your project\r\nSelect and assemble various types of connectors\r\nDo basic reverse engineering on a device in order to modify (hack) it\r\nUse open source tools for schematic capture and PCB layout\r\nMake smart choices when buying new or used test equipment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddd9e76f243bf6a89aac6c71be8636e5e839c54a","amp;dn":"Practical+Electronics+-+Components+and+Techniques+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddd9e76f243bf6a89aac6c71be8636e5e839c54a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,217,231,111,36,59,246,168,154,172,108,113,190,134,54,229,232,57,197,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
